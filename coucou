A PASSAGE TO INDIA 
PART I: MOSQUE 
CHAPTER I 

Except for the Marabar Caves—and they are twenty m
iles off —the city of Chandrapore presents 
nothing extraordinary. Edged rather than washed by the river Ganges, it trails for a couple 
of miles along the bank, scarcely distinguishable from the rubbish it deposits so freely. There 
are no bathing-steps on the river front, as the Ganges happens not to be holy here; indeed 
there is no river front, and bazaars shut out the wide and shifting panorama of the stream. The 
streets are mean, the temples ineffective, and though a few fine houses exist they are
 hidden 
away in gardens or down alleys whose filth deters all but the invited guest. Chandrapore was 
never large or beautiful, but two hundred years ago it lay on the road between Upper India, 
then imperial, and the sea, and the fine houses date from that period. The zest for decoration 
stopped in the eighteenth century, nor was it ever democratic. There is no painting and scarcely 
any carving in the bazaars. The very wood seems made of mud, the inhabitants of mud moving. 
So abased, so monotonous is 
everything that meets the eye, that when the Ganges comes 
down it might be expected to wash the excrescence back into the soil. Houses do fall, people 
are drowned and left rotting, but the general outline of the town persists, swelling here, shrinking 
there, like some low but indestructible form of life. 

Inland, the prospect alters. There is an oval Maidan, and a long sallow hospital. Houses belonging 
to Furasians stand on the high ground by the railway station. Beyond the railway—which 
runs paral
lel to the river— the land sinks, then rises again rather steeply. On the second rise is 
laid out the little civil station, and viewed hence Chandrapore appears to be a totally different 
place. It is a city of gardens. It is no city, but a forest sparsely scattered with huts. It is a tropical 
pleasaunce washed by a noble river. The toddy palms and neem trees and mangoes and pepul 
that were hidden behind the bazaars now become visible and in their turn hide the bazaars. 
They rise from the gardens whe
re ancient tanks nourish them, they burst out of stifiing purlieus 
and unconsidered temples. Seeking light and air, and endowed with more strength than man or 
his works, they soar above the lower deposit to greet one another with branches and beckoning 
leaves, and to build a city for the birds. Especially after the rains do they screen what passes 
below, but at all times, even when scorched or leafiess, they glorify the city to the English people 
who inhabit the rise, so that new-comers cannot believe
 it to be as meagre as it is described, 
and have to be driven down to acquire disillusionment. As for the civil station itself, it 
provokes no emotion. It charms not; neither does it repel. It is sensibly planned, with a redbrick 
club on its brow, and farther back a grocer's and a cemetery, and the bungalows are disposed 
along roads that intersect at right angles. It has nothing hideous in it, and only the view 
is beautiful; it shares nothing with the city except the overarching sky. 
The sky too has 
its changes, but they are less marked than those of the vegetation and the 
river. Clouds map it tip at times, but it is normally a dome of blending tints, and the main tint 
blue. By day the blue will pale down into white where it touches the white of the land, after 
sunset it has a new circumference— orange, melting upwards into tenderest purple. But the core 
of blue persists, and so it is by night. Then the stars hang like lamps from the immense vault. 
The distance between the vault and them is as 
nothing to the distance behind them, and that 
farther distance, though beyond colour, last freed itself from blue. 

The sky settles everything— not only climates and seasons but when the earth shall be beautiful. 
By herself she can do little— only feeble outbursts of fiowers. But when the sky chooses, 
glory can rain into the Chandrapore bazaars or a benediction pass from horizon to horizon. The 
sky can do this because it is so strong and so enormous. Strength comes from the sun, infused 
in it dai
ly; size from the prostrate earth. No mountains infringe on the curve. League after 
league the earth lies fiat, heaves a little, is fiat again. Only in the south, where a group of fists 
and fingers are thrust up through the soil, is the endless expanse interrupted. These fists and 
fingers are the Marabar Hills, containing the extraordinary caves. 



CHAPTER II 

Abandoning his bicycle, which fell before a servant could catch it, the young man sprang up 

on to the verandah. He was all animation. "Hamid
ullah, Hamidullah! am I late?" he cried. 

"Do not apologize," said his host. "You are always late." 

"Kindly answer my question. Am I late? Has Mahmoud Ali eaten all the food? If so I go 

elsewhere. Mr. Mahmoud Ali, how are you?" 

"Thank you. Dr. Aziz, I am dying." 

"Dying before your dinner? Oh, poor Malimoud Ali!" 

"Hamidullah here is actually dead. He passed away just as you rode up on your bike." 

"Yes, that is so," said the other. "Imagine us both as addressing you from another and a 

happier 
world." 

"Does there happen to be such a thing as a hookah in that happier world of yours?" 

"Aziz, don't chatter. We are having a very sad talk." 

The hookah had been packed too tight, as was usual in his friend's house, and bubbled 

sulkily. He coaxed it. Yielding at last, the tobacco jetted up into his lungs and nostrils, driving 

out the smoke of burning cow dung that had filled them as he rode through the bazaar. It was 

delicious. He lay in a trance, sensuous but healthy, through which the talk
 of the two others did 

not seem particularly sad—they were discussing as to whether or no it is possible to be friends 

with an Englishman. Mahmoud Ali argued that it was not, Hamidullah disagreed, but with so 

many reservations that there was no friction between them. Delicious indeed to lie on the broad 

verandah with the moon rising in front and the servants preparing dinner behind, and no trouble 

happening. 

"Well, look at my own experience this morning." 

"I only contend that it is possible
 in England," replied Hamidullah, who had been to that 

country long ago, before the big rush, and had received a cordial welcome at Cambridge. 

"It is impossible here. Aziz! The red-nosed boy has again insulted me in Court. I do not 

blame him. He was told that he ought to insult me. Until lately he was quite a nice boy, but the 

others have got hold of him." 

"Yes, they have no chance here, that is my point. They come out intending to be gentlemen, 

and are told it will not do. Look at Lesley, look
 at Blakiston, now it is your red-nosed boy, 

and Fielding will go next. Why, I remember when Turton came out first. It was in another part 

of the Province. You fellows will not believe me, but I have driven with Turton in his carriage— 

Turton! Oh yes, we were once quite intimate. He has shown me his stamp collection." 

"He would expect you to steal it now. Turton! But red-nosed boy will be far worse than Turton! " 

"I do not think so. They all become exactly the same, not worse, not better. I giv
e any Englishman 

two years, be he Turton or Burton. It is only the difference of a letter. And I give any 

Englishwoman six months. All are exactly alike. Do you not agree with me?" 

"I do not," replied Mahmoud Ali, entering into the bitter fun, and feeling both pain and 

amusement at each word that was uttered. "For my own part I find such profound differences 

among our rulers. Red-nose mumbles, Turton talks distinctly, Mrs. Turton takes bribes, Mrs. 

Red-nose does not and cannot, because so far t
here is no Mrs. Red-nose." 

"Bribes?" 

"Did you not know that when they were lent to Central India over a Canal Scheme, some 

Rajah or other gave her a sewing machine in solid gold so that the water should run through his 

state?" 

"And does it? 

"No, that is where Mrs. Turton is so skilful. When we poor blacks take bribes, we perform 

what we are bribed to perform, and the law discovers us in consequence. The English take and 

do nothing. I admire them." 

"We all admire them. Aziz, please pass me
 the hookah." 

"Oh, not yet—hookah is so jolly now." 

"You are a very selfish boy." He raised his voice suddenly, and shouted for dinner. Servants 



shouted back that it was ready. They meant that they wished it was ready, and were so understood, 

for nobody moved. Then Hamidullah continued, but with changed manner and evident 

emotion. 

"But take my case—the case of young Hugh Bannister. Here is the son of my dear, my dead 

friends, the Reverend and Mrs. Bannister, whose goodness to me in Engl
and I shall never forget 

or describe. They were father and mother to me, I talked to them as I do now. In the vacations 

their Rectory became my home. They entrusted all their children to me~I often carried little 

Hugh about~I took him up to the Funeral of Queen Victoria, and held him in my arms above the 

crowd." 

"Queen Victoria was different," murmured Mahmoud Ali. 

"I learn now that this boy is in business as a leather merchant at Cawnpore. Imagine how I 

long to see him and to pay his fare th
at this house may be his home. But it is useless. The 

other Anglo-Indians will have got hold of him long ago. He will probably think that I want 

something, 

and I cannot face that from the son of my old friends. Oh, what in this country has gone 

wrong with everything. Vakil Sahib? I ask you." 

Aziz joined in. "Why talk about the English? Brrrr . . . ! Why be either friends with the fellows 

or not friends? Let us shut them out and be jolly. Queen Victoria and Mrs. Bannister were 

the only excepti
ons, and they're dead." 

"No, no, I do not admit that, I have met others." 

"So have I," said Mahmoud Ali, unexpectedly veering. "All ladies are far from alike." Their 

mood was changed, and they recalled little kindnesses and courtesies. "She said 'Thank you so 

much' in the most natural way." "She offered me a lozenge when the dust irritated my throat." 

Hamidullah could remember more important examples of angelic ministration, but the other, 

who only knew Anglo-India, had to ransack his memory fo
r scraps, and it was not surprising 

that he should return to "But of course all this is exceptional. The exception does not prove the 

rule. The average woman is like Mrs. Turton, and, Aziz, you know what she is." Aziz did not 

know, but said he did. He too generalized from his disappointments—it is difficult for members 

of a subject race to do otherwise. Granted the exceptions, he agreed that all Englishwomen are 

haughty and venal. The gleam passed from the conversation, whose wintry surface unr
olled and 

expanded interminably. 

A servant announced dinner. They ignored him. The elder men had reached their eternal 

politics, Aziz drifted into the garden. The trees smelt sweet— green-blossomed champak— and 

scraps of Persian poetry came into his head. Dinner, dinner, dinner . . . but when he returned to 

the house for it, Mahmoud Ali had drifted away in his turn, to speak to his sais. "Come and see 

my wife a little then," said Hamidullah, and they spent twenty minutes behind the purdah. 


Hamidullah 

Begum was a distant aunt of Aziz, and the only female relative he had in Chandrapore, 

and she had much to say to him on this occasion about a family circumcision that had been 

celebrated with imperfect pomp. It was difficult to get away, because until they had had their 

dinner she would not begin hers, and consequently prolonged her remarks in case they should 

suppose she was impatient. Having censured the circumcision, she bethought her of kindred 

topics, and asked Aziz when he wa
s going to be married. 

Respectful but irritated, he answered, "Once is enough." 

"Yes, he has done his duty," said Hamidullah. "Do not tease him so. He carries on his family, 

two boys and their sister." 

"Aunt, they live most comfortably with my wife's mother, where she was living when she 

died. I can see them whenever I like. They are such very, very small children." 

"And he sends them the whole of his salary and lives like a low-grade clerk, and tells no one 

the reason. What more do you requi
re him to do?" 

But this was not Hamidullah Begum's point, and having courteously changed the conversation 

for a few moments she returned and made it. She said, "What is to become of all our 



daughters if men refuse to marry? They will marry beneath them, or--" And she began the ofttold 

tale of a lady of Imperial descent who could find no husband in the narrow circle where her 

pride permitted her to mate, and had lived on unwed, her age now thirty, and would die unwed, 

for no one would have her
 now. While the tale was in progress, it convinced the two men, the 

tragedy seemed a slur on the whole community; better polygamy almost, than that a woman 

should die without the joys God has intended her to receive. Wedlock, motherhood, power in 

the house—for what else is she born, and how can the man who has denied them to her stand 

up to face her creator and his own at the last day? Aziz took his leave saying "Perhaps . . but 

later . . ."--his invariable reply to such an appeal. 

"You mustn
't put off what you think right," said Hamidullah. "That is why India is in such a 

plight, because we put off things." But seeing that his young relative looked worried, he added 

a few soothing words, and thus wiped out any impression that his wife might have made. 

During their absence, Mahmoud All had gone off in his carriage leaving a message that he 

should be back in five minutes, but they were on no account to wait. They sat down to meat 

with a distant cousin of the house, Mohammed Latif, who
 lived on Hamidullah's bounty and who 

occupied the position neither of a servant nor of an equal. He did not speak unless spoken to, 

and since no one spoke kept unoffended silence. Now and then he belched, in compliment to 

the richness of the food. A gentle, happy and dishonest old man; all his life he had never done 

a stroke of work. So long as some one of his relatives had a house he was sure of a home, and 

it was unlikely that so large a family would all go bankrupt. His wife led a similar exi
stence some 

hundreds of miles away —he did not visit her, owing to the expense of the railway ticket. Presently 

Aziz chaffed him, also the servants, and then began quoting poetry, Persian, Urdu, a little 

Arabic. His memory was good, and for so young a man he had read largely; the themes he preferred 

were the decay of Islam and the brevity of Love. They listened delighted, for they took 

the public view of poetry, not the private which obtains in England. It never bored them to hear 

words, word
s; they breathed them with the cool night air, never stopping to analyse; the name 

of the poet, Hafiz, Hali, Iqbal, was sufficient guarantee. India—a hundred Indias— whispered 

outside beneath the indifferent moon, but for the time India seemed one and their own, and 

they regained their departed greatness by hearing its departure lamented, they felt young again 

because reminded that youth must fiy. A servant in scarlet interrupted him; he was the chuprassi 

of the Civil Surgeon, and he handed A
ziz a note. 

"Old Callendar wants to see me at his bungalow," he said, not rising. "He might have the 

politeness to say why." 

"Some case, I daresay." 

"I daresay not, I daresay nothing. He has found out our dinner hour, that's all, and chooses 

to interrupt us every time, in order to show his power." 

"On the one hand he always does this, on the other it may be a serious case, and you cannot 

know," said Hamidullah, considerately paving the way towards obedience. "Had you not 

better clean your t
eeth after pan?" 

"If my teeth are to be cleaned, I don't go at all. I am an Indian, it is an Indian habit to take 

pan. The Civil Surgeon must put up with it. Mohammed Latif, my bike, please." 

The poor relation got up. Slightly immersed in the realms of matter, he laid his hand on the 

bicycle's saddle, while a servant did the actual wheeling. Between them they took it over a tintack. 

Aziz held his hands under the ewer, dried them, fitted on his green felt hat, and then with 

unexpected energy whi
zzed out of Hamidullah's compound. 

"Aziz, Aziz, imprudent boy. ..." But he was far down the bazaar, riding furiously. He had 

neither light nor bell nor had he a brake, but what use are such adjuncts in a land where the 

cyclist's only hope is to coast from face to face, and just before he collides with each it vanishes? 

And the city was fairly empty at this hour. When his tyre went fiat, he leapt off and 

shouted for a tonga. 

He did not at first find one, and he had also to dispose of his bicycle
 at a friend's house. He 

dallied furthermore to clean his teeth. But at last he was rattling towards the civil lines, with a 



vivid sense of speed. As he entered their arid tidiness, depression suddenly seized him. The 

roads, named after victorious generals and intersecting at right angles, were symbolic of the net 

Great Britain had thrown over India. He felt caught in their meshes. When he turned into Major 

Callendar's compound he could with difficulty restrain himself from getting down from th
e tonga 

and approaching the bungalow on foot, and this not because his soul was servile but because 

his feelings—the sensitive edges of him— feared a gross snub. There had been a "case" last 

year—an Indian gentleman had driven up to an official's house and been turned back by the 

servants and been told to approach more suitably— only one case among thousands of visits to 

hundreds of officials, but its fame spread wide. The young man shrank from a repetition of it. 

He compromised, and st
opped the driver just outside the fiood of light that fell across the verandah. 

The Civil Surgeon was out. 

"But the sahib has left me some message?" 

The servant returned an indifferent "No." Aziz was in despair. It was a servant whom he had 

forgotten to tip, and he could do nothing now because there were people in the hall. He was 

convinced that there was a message, and that the man was withholding it out of revenge. While 

they argued, the people came out. Both were ladies. Aziz lifted his hat.
 The first, who was in 

evening dress, glanced at the Indian and turned instinctively away. 

"Mrs. Lesley, it _is_ a tonga," she cried. 

"Ours?" enquired the second, also seeing Aziz, and doing likewise. 

"Take the gifts the gods provide, anyhow," she screeched, and both jumped in. "0 Tonga 

wallah, club, club. Why doesn't the fool go?" 

"Go, I will pay you to-morrow," said Aziz to the driver, and as they went off he called courteously, 

"You are most welcome, ladies." They did not reply, being full
 of their own affairs. 

So it had come, the usual thing— just as Mahmoud Ali said. The inevitable snub— his bow ignored, 

his carriage taken. It might have been worse, for it comforted him somehow that Mesdames 

Callendar and Lesley should both be fat and weigh the tonga down behind. Beautiful 

women would have pained him. He turned to the servant, gave him a couple of rupees, and 

asked again whether there was a message. The man, now very civil, returned the same answer. 

Major Callendar had dri
ven away half an hour before. 

"Saying nothing?" 

He had as a matter of fact said, "Damn Aziz"— words that the servant understood, but was 

too polite to repeat. One can tip too much as well as too little, indeed the coin that buys the 

exact truth has not yet been minted. 

"Then I will write him a letter." 

He was offered the use of the house, but was too dignified to enter it. Paper and ink were 

brought on to the verandah. He began: "Dear Sir,— At your express command I have hastened 

as a s
ubordinate should—" and then stopped. "Tell him I have called, that is sufficient," he said, 

tearing the protest up. "Here is my card. Call me a tonga." 

"Huzoor, all are at the club." 

"Then telephone for one down to the railway station." And since the man hastened to do 

this he said, "Enough, enough, I prefer to walk." He commandeered a match and lit a cigarette. 

These attentions, though purchased, soothed him. They would last as long as he had rupees, 

which is something. But to shake the dus
t of Anglo-India off his feet! To escape from the net 

and be back among manners and gestures that he knew! He began a walk, an unwonted exercise. 

He was an athletic little man, daintily put together, but really very strong. Nevertheless 

walking fatigued him, as it fatigues everyone in India except the new-corner. There is something 

hostile in that soil. It either yields, and the foot sinks into a depression, or else it is unexpectedly 

rigid and sharp, pressing stones or crystals against the tread
. A series of these little surprises 

exhausts; and he was wearing pumps, a poor preparation for any country. At the edge of 

the civil station he turned into a mosque to rest. 

He had always liked this mosque. It was gracious, and the arrangement pleased him. The 

courtyard— entered through a ruined gate— contained an ablution tank of fresh clear water. 



which was always in motion, being indeed part of a conduit that supplied the city. The courtyard 

was paved with broken slabs. The covered pa
rt of the mosque was deeper than is usual; its effect 

was that of an English parish church whose side has been taken out. Where he sat, he 

looked into three arcades whose darkness was illuminated by a small hanging lamp and by the 

moon. The front—in full moonlight—had the appearance of marble, and the ninety-nine names 

of God on the frieze stood out black, as the frieze stood out white against the sky. The contest 

between this dualism and the contention of shadows within pleased Aziz, and he 
tried to symbolize 

the whole into some truth of religion or love. A mosque by winning his approval let loose 

his imagination. The temple of another creed, Hindu, Christian, or Greek, would have bored him 

and failed to awaken his sense of beauty. Here was Islam, his own country, more than a Faith, 

more than a battle-cry, more, much more . . . Islam, an attitude towards life both exquisite and 

durable, where his body and his thoughts found their home. 

His seat was the low wall that bounded the co
urtyard on the left. The ground fell away beneath 

him towards the city, visible as a blur of trees, and in the stillness he heard many small 

sounds. On the right, over in the club, the English community contributed an amateur orchestra. 

Elsewhere some Hindus were drumming— he knew they were Hindus, because the rhythm 

was uncongenial to him,— and others were bewailing a corpse— he knew whose, having certified 

it in the afternoon. There were owls, the Punjab mail . . . and flowers smelt delic
iously in the 

station-master's garden. But the mosque— that alone signified, and he returned to it from the 

complex appeal of the night, and decked it with meanings the builder had never intended. 

Some day he too would build a mosque, smaller than this but in perfect taste, so that all who 

passed by should experience the happiness he felt now. And near it, under a low dome, should 

be his tomb, with a Persian inscription: 

Alas, without me for thousands of years 

The Rose will blossom and the 
Spring will bloom. 

But those who have secretly understood my heart— 

They will approach and visit the grave where I lie. 

He had seen the quatrain on the tomb of a Deccan king, and regarded it as profound 

philosophy— he always held pathos to be profound. The secret understanding of the heart! He 

repeated the phrase with tears in his eyes, and as he did so one of the pillars of the mosque 

seemed to quiver. It swayed in the gloom and detached itself Belief in ghosts ran in his blood, 

but he s
at firm. Another pillar moved, a third, and then an Englishwoman stepped out into the 

moonlight. Suddenly he was furiously angry and shouted: "Madam! Madam! Madam!" 

"Oh! Oh!" the woman gasped. 

"Madam, this is a mosque, you have no right here at all; you should have taken off your 

shoes; this is a holy place for Moslems." 

"I have taken them off" 

"You have?" 

"I left them at the entrance." 

"Then I ask your pardon." 

Still startled, the woman moved out, keeping the ablution-tank between them. 
He called 

after her, "I am truly sorry for speaking." 

"Yes, I was right, was I not? If I remove my shoes, I am allowed?" 

"Of course, but so few ladies take the trouble, especially if thinking no one is there to see." 

"That makes no difference. God is here." 

"Madam!" 

"Please let me go." 

"Oh, can I do you some service now or at any time?" 

"No, thank you, really none— good night. " 

"May I know your name?" 

She was now in the shadow of the gateway, so that he could not see her face, but sh
e saw 

his, and she said with a change of voice, "Mrs. Moore." 



"Mrs. ~" Advancing, he found that she was old. A fabric bigger than the mosque fell to 

pieces, and he did not know whether he was glad or sorry. She was older than Hamidullah Begum, 

with a red face and white hair. Her voice had deceived him. 

"Mrs. Moore, I am afraid I startled you. I shall tell my community—our friends—about you. 

That God is here-very good, very fine indeed. I think you are newly arrived in India." 

"Yes— ho
w did you know?" 

"By the way you address me. No, but can I call you a carriage?" 

"I have only come from the club. They are doing a play that I have seen in London, and it 

was so hot. " 

"What was the name of the play?" 

"Cousin Kate." 

"I think you ought not to walk at night alone, Mrs. Moore. There are bad characters about 

and leopards may come across from the Marabar Hills. Snakes also." 

She exclaimed; she had forgotten the snakes. 

"For example, a six-spot beetle," he continued. "You pick 
it up, it bites, you die." 

"But you walk about yourself" 

"Oh, I am used to it." 

"Used to snakes?" 

They both laughed. "I'm a doctor," he said. "Snakes don't dare bite me." They sat down side 

by side in the entrance, and slipped on their evening shoes. "Please may I ask you a question 

now? Why do you come to India at this time of year, just as the cold weather is ending?" 

"I intended to start earlier, but there was an unavoidable delay." 

"It will soon be so unhealthy for you! And why ever do 
you come to Chandrapore?" 

"To visit my son. He is the City Magistrate here." 

"Oh no, excuse me, that is quite impossible. Our City Magistrate's name is Mr. Heaslop. I 

know him intimately." 

"He's my son all the same," she said, smiling. 

"But, Mrs. Moore, how can he be?" 

"I was married twice." 

"Yes, now I see, and your first husband died." 

"He did, and so did my second husband." 

"Then we are in the same box," he said cryptically. "Then is the City Magistrate the entire of 

your family now?
" 

"No, there are the younger ones— Ralph and Stella in England." 

"And the gentleman here, is he Ralph and Stella's half-brother?" 

"Quite right." 

"Mrs. Moore, this is all extremely strange, because like yourself I have also two sons and a 

daughter. Is not this the same box with a vengeance?" 

"What are their names? Not also Ronny, Ralph, and Stella, surely?" 

The suggestion delighted him. "No, indeed. How funny it sounds! Their names are quite different 

and will surprise you. Listen, please.
 I am about to tell you my children's names. The first 

is called Ahmed, the second is called Karim, the third— she is the eldest— Jamila. Three children 

are enough. Do not you agree with me?" 

"I do." 

They were both silent for a little, thinking of their respective families. She sighed and rose to 

go. 

"Would you care to see over the Minto Hospital one morning?" he enquired. "I have nothing 

else to offer at Chandrapore." 

"Thank you, I have seen it already, or I should have liked to come w
ith you very much." 

"I suppose the Civil Surgeon took you." 

"Yes, and Mrs. Callendar." 

His voice altered. "Ah! Avery charming lady." 



"Possibly, when one knows her better." 
"What? What? You didn't like her?" 

"She was certainly intending to be kind, but I did not find her exactly charming." 
He burst out with: "She has just taken my tonga without my permission—do you call that 
being charming?~and Major Callendar interrupts me night after night from where I am dining 
with my friends and I go 
at once, breaking tip a most pleasant entertainment, and he is not 
there and not even a message. Is this charming, pray? But what does it matter? I can do nothing 
and he knows it. I am just a subordinate, my time is of no value, the verandah is good 
enough for an Indian, yes, yes, let him stand, and Mrs. Callendar takes my carriage and cuts 
me dead ..." 
She listened. 

He was excited partly by his wrongs, but much more by the knowledge that someone sympathized 
with them. It was this that led him to r
epeat, exaggerate, contradict. She had proved 
her sympathy by criticizing her fell owcountry woman to him, but even earlier he had known. The 
flame that not even beauty can nourish was springing up, and though his words were querulous 
his heart began to glow secretly. Presently it burst into speech. 
"You understand me, you know what others feel. Oh, if others resembled you! " 
Rather surprised, she replied: "I don't think 1 understand people very well. I only know 
whether I like or dislike them." 
"Th
en you are an Oriental." 

She accepted his escort back to the club, and said at the gate that she wished she was a 
member, so that she could have asked him in. 

"Indians are not allowed into the Chandrapore Club even as guests," he said simply. He did 
not expatiate on his wrongs now, being happy. As he strolled downhill beneath the lovely moon, 
and again saw the lovely mosque, he seemed to own the land as much as anyone owned it. 
What did it matter if a few flabby Hindus had preceded him there, and a
 few chilly English 
succeeded? 
CHAPTER III 

The third act of Cousin Kate_ was well advanced by the time Mrs. Moore re-entered the 
club. Windows were barred, lest the servants should see their mem-sahibs acting, and the heat 
was consequently immense. One electric fan revolved like a wounded bird, another was out of 
order. Disinclined to return to tile audience, she went into the billiard room, where she was 
greeted by "I want to see the _real_ India," and her appropriate life came back with a rush. 

This was Adela Quested, the queer, cautious girl whom Ronny had commissioned her to bring 
from England, and Ronny was her son, also cautious, whom Miss Quested would probably 
though not certainly marry, and she herself was an elderly lady. 

"I want to see it too, and I only wish we could. Apparently the Turtons will arrange something 
for next Tuesday." 

"It'll end in an elephant ride, it always does. Look at this evening. Cousin Kate!_ Imagine, 
Cousin Kate!_ But where have you been off to? Did you su
cceed in catching the moon in the 
Ganges?" 

The two ladies had happened, the night before, to see the moon's reflection in a distant 
channel of the stream. The water had drawn it out, so that it had seemed larger than the real 
moon, and brighter, which had pleased them. 
"I went to the mosque, but I did not catch the moon." 
"The angle would have altered—she rises later." 

"Later and later," yawned Mrs. Moore, who was tired after her walk. "Let me think— we don't 
see the other side of the moon ou
t here, no." 

"Come, India's not as bad as all that," said a pleasant voice. "Other side of the earth, if you 
like, but we stick to the same old moon." Neither of them knew the speaker nor did they ever 
see him again. He passed with his friendly word through red-brick pillars into the darkness. 
"We aren't even seeing the other side of the world; that's our complaint," said Adela. Mrs. 



Moore agreed; she too was disappointed at the dullness of their new life. They had made such 

a romantic voyage ac
ross the Mediterranean and through the sands of Egypt to the harbour of 

Bombay, to find only a gridiron of bungalows at the end of it. But she did not take the 

disappointment 

as seriously as Miss Quested, for the reason that she was forty years older, and had 

learnt that Life never gives us what we want at the moment that we consider appropriate. 

Adventures 

do occur, but not punctually. She said again that she hoped that something interesting 

would be arranged for next Tuesday. 

"Have a drin
k," said another pleasant voice. "Mrs. Moore—Miss Quested—have a drink, have 

two drinks." They knew who it was this time— the Collector, Mr. Turton, with whom they had 

dined. Like themselves, he had found the atmosphere of Cousin Kate_ too hot. Ronny, he told 

them, was stage-managing in place of Major Callendar, whom some native subordinate or other 

had let down, and doing it very well; then he turned to Ronny's other merits, and in quiet, decisive 

tones said much that was fiattering. It wa
sn't that the young man was particularly good at 

the games or the lingo, or that he had much notion of the Law, but— apparently a large but— 

Ronny was dignified. 

Mrs. Moore was surprised to learn this, dignity not being a quality with which any mother 

credits her son. Miss Quested learnt it with anxiety, for she had not decided whether she liked 

dignified men. She tried indeed to discuss this point with Mr. Turton, but he silenced her with a 

good-humoured motion of his hand, and continued w
hat he had come to say. "The long and the 

short of it is Heaslop's a sahib; he's the type we want, he's one of us," and another civilian who 

was leaning over the billiard table said, " Hear, hear! " The matter was thus placed beyond 

doubt, and the Collector passed on, for other duties called him. 

Meanwhile the performance ended, and the amateur orchestra played the National Anthem. 

Conversation and billiards stopped, faces stiffened. It was the Anthem of the Army of Occupation. 

it reminded ever
y member of the club that he or she was British and in exile. It produced a 

little sentiment and a useful accession of willpower. The meagre tune, the curt series of demands 

on Jehovah, fused into a prayer unknown in England, and though they perceived neither 

Royalty nor Deity they did perceive something, they were strengthened to resist another day. 

Then they poured out, offering one another drinks. 

"Adela, have a drink; mother, a drink." 

They refused— they were weary of drinks— and Miss Q
uested, who always said exactly what 

was in her mind, announced anew that she was desirous of seeing the real India. 

Ronny was in high spirits. The request struck him as comic, and he called out to another 

passer-by: "Fielding! how's one to see the real India?" 

"Try seeing Indians," the man answered, and vanished. 

"Who was that?" 

"Our schoolmaster— Government College." 

"As if one could avoid seeing them," sighed Mrs. Lesley. 

"I've avoided," said Miss Quested. "Excepting my own servant, I'
ve scarcely spoken to an 

Indian since landing." 

"Oh, lucky you." 

"But I want to see them." 

She became the centre of an amused group of ladies. One said, "Wanting to see Indians! 

How new that sounds!" Another, "Natives! why, fancy!" A third, more serious, said, "Let me 

explain. 

Natives don't respect one any the more after meeting one, you see." 

"That occurs after so many meetings." 

But the lady, entirely stupid and friendly, continued: "What I mean is, I was a nurse before 

my marriage, a
nd came across them a great deal, so I know. I really do know the truth about 

Indians. A most unsuitable position for any Englishwoman— I was a nurse in a Native State. 



One's only hope was to hold sternly aloof." 

"Even from one's patients?" 

"Why, the kindest thing one can do to a native is to let him die," said Mrs. Callendar. 

"How if he went to heaven? "asked Mrs. Moore, with a gentle but crooked smile. 

"He can go where he likes as long as he doesn't come near me. They give me the creeps."
 

"As a matter of fact I have thought what you were saying about heaven, and that is why I 

am against Missionaries," said the lady who had been a nurse. "I am all for Chaplains, but all 

against Missionaries. Let me explain." 

But before she could do so, the Collector intervened. 

"Do you really want to meet the Aryan Brother, Miss Quested? That can be easily fixed up. I 

didn't realize he'd amuse you." He thought a moment. "You can practically see any type you 

like. Take your choice. I know the G
overnment people and the landowners, Heaslop here can 

get hold of the barrister crew, while if you want to specialize on education, we can come down 

on Fielding." 

"I'm tired of seeing picturesque figures pass before me as a frieze," the girl explained. "It 

was wonderful when we landed, but that superficial glamour soon goes." 

Her impressions were of no interest to the Collector; he was only concerned to give her a 

good time. Would she like a Bridge Party? He explained to her what that was—not
 the game, 

but a party to bridge the gulf between East and West; the expression was his own invention, 

and amused all who heard it. 

"I only want those Indians whom you come across socially—as your friends." 

"Well, we don't come across them socially," he said, laughing. "They're full of all the virtues, 

but we don't, and it's now eleven-thirty, and too late to go into the reasons." 

"Miss Quested, what a name! " remarked Mrs. Turton to her husband as they drove away. 

She had not taken to the 
new young lady, thinking her ungracious and cranky. She trusted that 

she hadn't been brought out to marry nice little Heaslop, though it looked like it. Her husband 

agreed with her in his heart, but he never spoke against an Englishwoman if he could avoid doing 

so, and he only said that Miss Quested naturally made mistakes. He added: "India does 

wonders for the judgment, especially during the hot weather; it has even done wonders for 

Fielding." Mrs. Turton closed her eyes at this name and remarke
d that Mr. Fielding wasn't 

pukka, and had better marry Miss Quested, for she wasn't pukka. Then they reached their bungalow, 

low and enormous, the oldest and most uncomfortable bungalow in the civil station, with 

a sunk soup plate of a lawn, and they had one drink more, this time of barley water, and went 

to bed. Their withdrawal from the club had broken up the evening, which, like all gatherings, 

had an official tinge. A community that bows the knee to a Viceroy and believes that the divinity 


that hedges a king can be transplanted, must feel some reverence for any viceregal substitute. 

At Chandrapore the Turtons were little gods; soon they would retire to some suburban villa, and 

die exiled from glory. 

"It's decent of the Burra Sahib," chattered Ronny, much gratified at the civility that had been 

shown to his guests. "Do you know he's never given a Bridge Party before? Coming on top of 

the dinner too! I wish I could have arranged something myself, but when you know the natives 

bette
r you'll realize it's easier for the Burra Sahib than for me. They know him— they know be 

can't be fooled— I'm still fresh comparatively. No one can even begin to think of knowing this 

country until he has been in it twehty years.— Hullo, the mater! Here's your cloak.— Well: for an 

example of the mistakes one makes. Soon after I came out I asked one of the Pleaders to have 

a smoke with me-only a cigarette, mind. I found afterwards that he had sent touts all over the 

bazaar to announce the
 fact— told all the litigants, 'Oh, you'd better come to my Vakil Mahmoud 

Ali— he's in with the City Magistrate.' Ever since then I've dropped on him in Court as hard as I 

could. It's taught me a lesson, and I hope him." 

"Isn't the lesson that you should invite all the Pleaders to have a smoke with you?" 

"Perhaps, but time's limited and the flesh weak. I prefer my smoke at the club amongst my 

own sort, I'm afraid." 



"Why not ask the Pleaders to the club?" Miss Quested persisted. 

"Not all
owed." He was pleasant and patient, and evidently understood why she did not understand. 

He implied that he had once been as she, though not for long. Going to the verandah, 

he called firmly to the moon. His sais answered, and without lowering his head, he ordered his 

trap to be brought round. 

Mrs. Moore, whom the club had stupefied, woke up outside. She watched the moon, whose 

radiance stained with primrose the purple of the surrounding sky. In England the moon had 

seemed dead and alien; here 
she was caught in the shawl of night together with earth and all 

the other stars. A sudden sense of unity, of kinship with the heavenly bodies, passed into the 

old woman and out, like water through a tank, leaving a strange freshness behind. She did not 

dislike Cousin Kate_ or the National Anthem, but their note had died into a new one, just as 

cocktails and cigars had died into invisible flowers. When the mosque, long and domeless, 

gleamed at the turn of the road, she exclaimed, "Oh, yes—that'
s where I got to—that's where 

I've been." 

"Been there when?" asked her son. 

"Between the acts." 

"But, mother, you can't do that sort of thing." 

"Can't mother?" she replied. 

"No, really not in this country. It's not done. There's the danger from snakes for one thing. 

They are apt to lie out in the evening." 

"Ah yes, so the young man there said." 

"This sounds very romantic," said Miss Quested, who was exceedingly fond of Mrs. Moore, 

and was glad she should have had this little escapade.
 "You meet a young man in a mosque, 

and then never let me know! " 

"I was going to tell you, Adela, but something changed the conversation and I forgot. My 

memory grows deplorable." 

"Was he nice?" 

She paused, then said emphatically: "Very nice." 

"Who was he?" Ronny enquired. 

"A doctor. I don't know his name." 

"A doctor? I know of no young doctor in Chandrapore. How odd! What was he like?" 

"Rather small, with a little moustache and quick eyes. He called out to me when I was in the 

dark pa
rt of the mosque— about my shoes. That was how we began talking. He was afraid I had 

them on, but I remembered luckily. He told me about his children, and then we walked back to 

the club. He knows you well." 

"I wish you had pointed him out to me. I can't make out who he is." 

"He didn't come into the club. He said he wasn't allowed to." 

Thereupon the truth struck him, and he cried, "Oh, good gracious! Not a Mohammedan? 

Why ever didn't you tell me you'd been talking to a native? I was going all
 wrong." 

"A Mohammedan! How perfectly magnificent!" exclaimed Miss Quested. "Ronny, isn't that 

like your mother? While we talk about seeing the real India, she goes and sees it, and then forgets 

she's seen it." 

But Ronny was ruffled. From his mother's description he had thought the doctor might be 

young Muggins from over the Ganges, and had brought out all the comradely emotions. What a 

mix-up! Why hadn't she indicated by the tone of her voice that she was talking about an Indian? 

Scratchy an
d dictatorial, he began to question her. "He called to you in the mosque, did 

he? How? Impudently? What was he doing there himself at that time of night?— No, it's not their 

prayer time."— This in answer to a suggestion of Miss Quested's, who showed the keenest interest. 

"So he called to you over your shoes. Then it was impudence. It's an old trick. I wish you 

had had them on." 

"I think it was impudence, but I don't know about a trick," said Mrs. Moore. "His nerves 

were all on edge— I cou
ld tell from his voice. As soon as I answered he altered." 



"You oughtn't to have answered." 

"Now look here," said the logical girl, "wouldn't you expect a Mohammedan to answer if you 

asked him to take off his hat in church?" 

"It's different, it's different; you don't understand." 

"I know I don't, and I want to. What is the difference, please?" 

He wished she wouldn't interfere. His mother did not signify—she was just a globe-trotter, a 

temporary escort, who could retire to England with wha
t impressions she chose. But Adela, who 

meditated spending her life in the country, was a more serious matter; it would be tiresome if 

she started crooked over the native question. Pulling up the mare, he said, "There's your 

Ganges." 

Their attention was diverted. Below them a radiance had suddenly appeared. It belonged 

neither to water nor moonlight, but stood like a luminous sheaf upon the fields of darkness. He 

told them that it was where the new sand-bank was forming, and that the dark ravel
led bit at 

the top was the sand, and that the dead bodies floated down that way from Benares, or would 

if the crocodiles let them. "It's not much of a dead body that gets down to Chandrapore." 

"Crocodiles down in it too, how terrible!" his mother murmured. The young people glanced 

at each other and smiled; it amused them when the old lady got these gentle creeps, and harmony 

was restored between them consequently. She continued: "What a terrible river! what a 

wonderful river! "and sighed. The r
adiance was already altering, whether through shifting of the 

moon or of the sand; soon the bright sheaf would be gone, and a circlet, itself to alter, be burnished 

upon the streaming void. The women discussed whether they would wait for the change 

or not, while the silence broke into patches of unquietness and the mare shivered. On her account 

they did not wait, but drove on to the City Magistrate's bungalow, where Miss Quested 

went to bed, and Mrs. Moore had a short interview with her son. 

He
 wanted to enquire about the Mohammedan doctor in the mosque. It was his duty to report 

suspicious characters and conceivably it was some disreputable hakirn who had prowled up 

from the bazaar. When she told him that it was someone connected with the Minto Hospital, he 

was relieved, and said that the fellow's name must be Aziz, and that he was quite all right, 

nothing against him at all. 

"Aziz! what a charming name!" 

"So you and he had a talk. Did you gather he was well disposed?" 

Ignorant of
 the force of this question, she replied, "Yes, quite, after the first moment." 

"I meant, generally. Did he seem to tolerate us~the brutal conqueror, the sundried bureaucrat, 

that sort of thing?" 

"Oh, yes, I think so, except the Callendars~he doesn't care for the Callendars at all." 

"Oh. So he told you that, did he? The Major will be interested. I wonder what was the aim 

of the remark." 

"Ronny, Ronny! you're never going to pass it on to Major Callendar?" 

"Yes, rather. I must, in fact!" 

"But
, my dear boy--" 

"If the Major heard I was disliked by any native subordinate of mine, I should expect him to 

pass it on tome." 

"But, my dear boy~a private conversation!" 

"Nothing's private in India. Aziz knew that when he spoke out, so don't you worry. He had 

some motive in what he said. My personal belief is that the remark wasn't true." 

"How not true?" 

"He abused the Major in order to impress you." 

"I don't know what you mean, dear." 

"It's the educated native's latest dodge. They used 
to cringe, but the younger generation 

believe in a show of manly independence. They think it will pay better with the itinerant M.P. 

But whether the native swaggers or cringes, there's always something behind every remark he 

makes, always something, and if nothing else he's trying to increase his izzat~in plain knglo- 



Saxon, to score. Of course there are exceptions." 

"You never used to judge people like this at home." 

"India isn't home," he retorted, rather rudely, but in order to silence her
 he had been using 

phrases and arguments that he had picked up from older officials, and he did not feel quite sure 

of himself When he said "of course there are exceptions" he was quoting Mr. Turton, while " 

increasing the izzat" was Major Callendar's own. The phrases worked and were in current use at 

the club, but she was rather clever at detecting the first from the second hand, and might press 

him for definite examples. 

She only said, "I can't deny that what you say sounds very sensible, but
 you really must not 

hand on to Major Callendar anything I have told you about Doctor Aziz." 

He felt disloyal to his caste, but he promised, adding, "In return please don't talk about Aziz 

to Adela." 

"Not talk about him? Why?" 

"There you go again, mother~I really can't explain every thing. I don't want Adela to be 

worried, that's the fact; she'll begin wondering whether we treat the natives properly, and all 

that sort of nonsense." 

"But she came out to be worried—that's exactly why she's 
here. She discussed it all on the 

boat. We had a long talk when we went on shore at Aden. She knows you in play, as she put it, 

but not in work, and she felt she must come and look round, before she decided—and before 

you decided. She is very, very fair-minded." 

"I know," he said dejectedly. 

The note of anxiety in his voice made her feel that he was still a little boy, who must have 

what he liked, so she promised to do as he wished, and they kissed good night. He had not 

forbidden 

her to 
think about Aziz, however, and she did this when she retired to her room. In the 

light of her son's comment she reconsidered the scene at the mosque, to see whose impression 

was correct. Yes, it could be worked into quite an unpleasant scene. The doctor had begun by 

bullying her, had said Mrs. Callendar was nice, and then— finding the ground safe— had changed; 

he had alternately whined over his grievances and patronized her, had run a dozen ways in a 

single sentence, had been unreliable, inqu
isitive, vain. Yes, it was all true, but how false as a 

summary of the man; the essential life of him had been slain. 

Going to hang up her cloak, she found that the tip of the peg was occupied by a small wasp. 

She had known this wasp or his relatives by day; they were not as English wasps, but had long 

yellow legs which hung down behind when they flew. Perhaps he mistook the peg for a 

branch— no Indian animal has any sense of an interior. Bats, rats, birds, insects will as soon nest 

inside a 
house as out; it is to them a normal growth of the eternal jungle, which alternately 

produces houses trees, houses trees. There he clung, asleep, while jackals in the plain bayed 

their desires and mingled with the percussion of drums. 

"Pretty dear," said Mrs. Moore to the wasp. He did not wake, but her voice floated out, to 

swell the night's uneasiness. 

CHAPTER IV 

The Collector kept his word. Next day he issued invitation cards to numerous Indian gentlemen 

in the neighbourhood, stating that h
e would be at home in the garden of the club between 

the hours of five and seven on the following Tuesday, also that Mrs. Turton would be glad 

to receive any ladies of their families who were out of purdah. His action caused much excitement 

and was discussed in several worlds. 

"It is owing to orders from the L.G.," was Mahmoud All's explanation. "Turton would never 

do this unless compelled. Those high officials are different— they sympathize, the Viceroy 

sympathizes, 

they would have us trea
ted properly. But they come too seldom and live too far away. 

Meanwhile—" 

"It is easy to sympathize at a distance," said an old gentleman with a beard. "I value more 



the kind word that is spoken close to my ear. Mr. Turton has spoken it, from whatever cause. He 

speaks, we hear. I do not see why we need discuss it further." Quotations followed from the Koran. 

"We have not all your sweet nature, Nawab Bahadur, nor your learning." 

"The Lieutenant-Governor may be my very good friend, but I give
 him no trouble. —How do 

you do, Nawab Bahadur? —Quite well, thank you. Sir Gilbert; how are you?~And all is over. But I 

can be a thorn in Mr. Turton's flesh, and if he asks me I accept the invitation. I shall come in 

from Dilkusha specially, though I have to postpone other business." 

"You will make yourself chip," suddenly said a little black man. 

There was a stir of disapproval. Who was this ill-bred upstart, that he should criticize the 

leading Mohammedan landowner of the district? Mahmo
ud Ali, though sharing his opinion, felt 

bound to oppose it. "Mr. Ram Chand!" he said, swaying forward stiffly with his hands on his 

hips. 

"Mr. Mahmoud Ali!" 

"Mr. Ram Chand, the Nawab Bahadur can decide what is cheap without our valuation, I 

think." 

"I do not expect I shall make myself cheap," said the Nawab Bahadur to Mr. Ram Chand, 

speaking very pleasantly, for he was aware that the man had been impolite and he desired to 

shield him from the consequences. It had passed through his mind to
 reply, "I expect I shall 

make myself cheap," but he rejected this as the less courteous alternative. "I do not see why 

we should make ourselves cheap. I do not see why we should. The invitation is worded very 

graciously." Feeling that he could not further decrease the social gulf between himself and his 

auditors, he sent his elegant grandson, who was in attendance on him, to fetch his car. When it 

came, he repeated all that he had said before, though at greater length, ending up with "Till 

Tue
sday, then, gentlemen all, when I hope we may meet in the flower gardens of the club." 

This opinion carried great weight. The Nawab Bahadur was a big proprietor and a philanthropist, 

a man of benevolence and decision. His character among all the communities in the 

province stood high. He was a straightforward enemy and a staunch friend, and his hospitality 

was proverbial. "Give, do not lend; after death who will thank you?" was his favourite remark. 

He held it a disgrace to die rich. When such a 
man was prepared to motor twenty-five miles to 

shake the Collector's hand, the entertainment took another aspect. For he was not like some 

eminent men, who give out that they will come, and then fail at the last moment, leaving the 

small fry floundering. If he said he would come, he would come, he would never deceive his 

supporters. The gentlemen whom he had lectured now urged one another to attend the party, 

although convinced at heart that his advice was unsound. 

He had spoken in the little r
oom near the Courts where the pleaders waited for clients; clients, 

waiting for pleaders, sat in the dust outside. These had not received a card from Mr. Turton. 

And there were circles even beyond these—people who wore nothing but a loincloth, people 

who wore not even that, and spent their lives in knocking two sticks together before a scarlet 

doll— humanity grading and drifting beyond the educated vision, until no earthly invitation 

can embrace it. 

All invitations must proceed from heaven 
perhaps; perhaps it is futile for men to initiate 

their own unity, they do but widen the gulfs between them by the attempt. So at all events 

thought old Mr. Graysford and young Mr. Sorley, the devoted missionaries who lived out beyond 

the slaughterhouses, always travelled third on the railways, and never came up to the club. In 

our Father's house are many mansions, they taught, and there alone will the incompatible multitudes 

of mankind be welcomed and soothed. Not one shall be turned away by the
 servants on 

that verandah, be he black or white, not one shall be kept standing who approaches with a loving 

heart. And why should the divine hospitality cease here? Consider, with all reverence, the 

monkeys. May there not be a mansion for the monkeys also? Old Mr. Graysford said No, but 

young Mr. Sorley, who was advanced, said Yes; he saw no reason why monkeys should not have 

their collateral share of bliss, and he had sympathetic discussions about them with his Hindu 

friends. And the jackals
? Jackals were indeed less to Mr. Sorley's mind, but he admitted that the 



mercy of God, being infinite, may well embrace all mammals. And the wasps? He became uneasy 

during the descent to wasps, and was apt to change the conversation. And oranges, cactuses, 

crystals and mud? and the bacteria inside Mr. Sorley? No, no, this is going too far. We 

must exclude someone from our gathering, or we shall be left with nothing. 

CHAPTER V 

The Bridge Party was not a success—at least it was not what Mrs.
 Moore and Miss Quested 

were accustomed to consider a successful party. They arrived early, since it was given in their 

honour, but most of the Indian guests had arrived even earlier, and stood massed at the farther 

side of the tennis lawns, doing nothing. 

"It is only just five," said Mrs. Turton. "My husband will be up from his office in a moment 

and start the thing. I have no idea what we have to do. It's the first time we've ever given a 

party like this at the club. Mr. Heaslop, when I'm dea
d and gone will you give parties like this? 

It's enough to make the old type of Burra Sahib turn in his grave." 

Ronny laughed deferentially. "You wanted something not picturesque and we've provided it," 

he remarked to Miss Quested. "What do you think of the Aryan Brother in a topi and spats?" 

Neither she nor his mother answered. They were gazing rather sadly over the tennis lawn. 

No, it was not picturesque; the East, abandoning its secular magnificence, was descending into 

a valley whose farthe
r side no man can see. 

"The great point to remember is that no one who's here matters; those who matter don't 

come. Isn't that so, Mrs. Turton?" 

"Absolutely true," said the great lady, leaning back. She was "saving herself up," as she 

called it—not for anything that would happen that afternoon or even that week, but for some 

vague future occasion when a high official might come along and tax her social strength. Most 

of her public appearances were marked by this air of reserve. 

Assured of h
er approbation, Ronny continued: "The educated Indians will be no good to us 

if there's a row, it's simply not worth while conciliating them, that's why they don't matter. Most 

of the people you see are seditious at heart, and the rest 'Id run squealing. The cultivator— he's 

another story. The Pathan— he's a man if you like. But these people— don't imagine they're India." 

He pointed to the dusky line beyond the court, and here and there it flashed a pince-nez 

or shuffled a shoe, as if aware
 that he was despising it. European costume had lighted like a 

leprosy. Few had yielded entirely, but none were untouched. There was a silence when he had 

finished speaking, on both sides of the court; at least, more ladies joined the English group, but 

their words seemed to die as soon as uttered. Some kites hovered overhead, impartial, over the 

kites passed the mass of a vulture, and with an impartiality exceeding all, the sky, not deeply 

coloured but translucent, poured light from its whole ci
rcumference. It seemed unlikely that the 

series stopped here. Beyond the sky must not there be something that overarches all the skies, 

more impartial even than they? Beyond which again . . . 

They spoke of Cousin Kate_. 

They had tried to reproduce their own attitude to life upon the stage, and to dress up as the 

middle-class English people they actually were. Next year they would do Quality Street_ or 

The Yeomen of the Guard_. Save for this annual incursion, they left literature alone. The men 

had no time for it, the women did nothing that they could not share with the men. Their ignorance 
of the Arts was notable, and they lost no opportunity of proclaiming it to one another; it 
was the Public School attitude; flourishing more vigorously than it can yet hope to do in England. 
If Indians were shop, the Arts were bad form, and Ronny had repressed his mother when 
she enquired after his viola; a viola was almost a demerit, and certainly not the sort of instrument 
one mentioned in public. She n
oticed now how tolerant and conventional his judgments 
had become; when they had seen Cousin Kate_ in London together in the past, he had 
scorned it; now he pretended that it was a good play, in order to hurt nobody's feelings. An 
"unkind notice" had appeared in the local paper, "the sort of thing no white man could have 
written," as Mrs. Lesley said. The play was praised, to be sure, and so were the stage management 
and the performance as a whole, but the notice contained the following sentence: "Mis
s 



Derek, though she charmingly looked her part, lacked the necessary experience, and occasionally 

forgot her words." This tiny breath of genuine criticism had given deep offence, not indeed 

to Miss Derek, who was as hard as nails, but to her friends. Miss Derek did not belong to 

Chandrapore. She was stopping for a fortnight with the McBrydes, the police people, and she 

had been so good as to fill up a gap in the cast at the last moment. A nice impression of local 

hospitality she would carry a
way with here 

"To work, Mary, to work," cried the Collector, touching his wife on the shoulder with a 

switch. 

Mrs. Turton got up awkwardly. "What do you want me to do? Oh, those purdah women! I 

never thought any would come. Oh dear! " 

A little group of Indian ladies had been gathering in a third quarter of the grounds, near a 

rustic summer-house in which the more timid of them had already taken refuge. The rest stood 

with their backs to the company and their faces pressed into a bank of shrub
s. At a little distance 

stood their male relatives, watching the venture. The sight was significant: an island 

bared by the turning tide, and bound to grow. 

"I consider they ought to come over to me." 

"Come along, Mary, get it over." 

"I refuse to shake hands with any of the men, unless it has to be the Nawab Bahadur." 

"Whom have we so far?" He glanced along the line. "H'm! h'm! much as one expected. We 

know why he's here, I think—over that contract, and he wants to get the right side of me 
for 

Mohurram, and he's the astrologer who wants to dodge the municipal building regulations, and 

he's that Parsi, and he's—Hullo! there he goes— smash into our hollyhocks. Pulled the left rein 

when he meant the right. All as usual." 

"They ought never to have been allowed to drive in; it's so bad for them," said Mrs. Turton, 

who had at last begun her progress to the summer-house, accompanied by Mrs. Moore, Miss 

Quested, and a terrier. "Why they come at all I don't know. They hate it as much 
as we do. Talk 

to Mrs. McBryde. Her husband made her give purdah parties until she struck." 

"This isn't a purdah party," corrected Miss Quested. 

"Oh, really," was the haughty rejoinder. 

"Do kindly tell us who these ladies are," asked Mrs. Moore. 

"You're superior to them, anyway. Don't forget that. You're superior to everyone in India except 

one or two of the Ranis, and they're on an equality." 

Advancing, she shook hands with the group and said a few words of welcome in Urdu. She 

had learnt 
the lingo, but only to speak to her servants, so she knew none of the politer forms 

and of the verbs only the imperative mood. As soon as her speech was over, she enquired of 

her companions, "Is that what you wanted?" 

"Please tell these ladies that I wish we could speak their language, but we have only just 

come to their country." 

"Perhaps we speak yours a little," one of the ladies said. 

"Why, fancy, she understands!" said Mrs. Turton. 

"Eastbourne, Piccadilly, High Park Corner," said another
 of the ladies. 

"Oh yes, they're English-speaking." 

"But now we can talk: how delightful! " cried Adela, her face lighting up. 

"She knows Paris also," called one of the onlookers. 

"They pass Paris on the way, no doubt," said Mrs. Turton, as if she was describing the 

movements of migratory birds. Her manner had grown more distant since she had discovered 

that some of the group was Westernized, and might apply her own standards to her. 

"The shorter lady, she is my wife, she is Mrs. Bhattacharya
," the onlooker explained. "The 

taller lady, she is my sister, she is Mrs. Das." 

The shorter and the taller ladies both adjusted their saris, and smiled. There was a curious 

uncertainty about their gestures, as if they sought for a new formula which neither East nor 

West could provide. When Mrs. Bhattacharya' s husband spoke, she turned away from him, but 



she did not mind seeing the other men. Indeed all the ladies were uncertain, cowering, recovering, 

giggling, making tiny gestures of atonem
ent or despair at all that was said, and alternately 

fondling the terrier or shrinking from him. Miss Quested now had her desired opportunity; 

friendly Indians were before her, and she tried to make them talk, but she failed, she strove in 

vain against the echoing walls of their civility. Whatever she said produced a murmur of 

deprecation, 

varying into a murmur of concern when she dropped her pocket-handkerchief She tried 

doing nothing, to see what that produced, and they too did nothing. Mrs. 
Moore was equally 

unsuccessful. Mrs. Turton waited for them with a detached expression; she had known what 

nonsense it all was from the first. 

When they took their leave, Mrs. Moore had an impulse, and said to Mrs. Bhattacharya, 

whose face she liked, "I wonder whether you would allow us to call on you some day." 

"When?" she replied, inclining charmingly. 

"Whenever is convenient." 

"All days are convenient." 

"Thursday ..." 

"Most certainly." 

"We shall enjoy it greatly, it would be a real p
leasure. What about the time?" 

"All hours." 

"Tell us which you would prefer. We're quite strangers to your country; we don't know when 

you have visitors," said Miss Quested. 

Mrs. Bhattacharya seemed not to know either. Her gesture implied that she had known, 

since Thursdays began, that English ladies would come to see her on one of them, and so always 

stayed in. Everything pleased her, nothing surprised. She added, "We leave for Calcutta 

to-day." 

"Oh, do you?" said Adela, not at first seein
g the implication. Then she cried, "Oh, but if you 

do we shall find you gone." 

Mrs. Bhattacharya did not dispute it. But her husband called from the distance, "Yes, yes, 

you come to us Thursday." 

"But you'll be in Calcutta." 

"No, no, we shall not." He said something swiftly to his wife in Bengali. "We expect you 

Thursday." 

"Thursday ..." the woman echoed. 

"You can't have done such a dreadful thing as to put off going for our sake?" exclaimed Mrs. 

Moore. 

"No, of course not, we are not su
ch people." He was laughing. 

"I believe that you have. Oh, please—it distresses me beyond words." 

Everyone was laughing now, but with no suggestion that they had blundered. A shapeless 

discussion occurred, during which Mrs. Turton retired, smiling to herself The upshot was that 

they were to come Thursday, but early in the morning, so as to wreck the Bhattacharya plans as 

little as possible, and Mr. Bhattacharya would send his carriage to fetch them, with servants to 

point out the way. Did he 
know where they lived? Yes, of course he knew, he knew everything; 

and he laughed again. They left among a flutter of compliments and smiles, and three ladies, 

who had hitherto taken no part in the reception, suddenly shot out of the summer-house like 

exquisitely coloured swallows, and salaamed them. 

Meanwhile the Collector had been going his rounds. He made pleasant remarks and a few 

jokes, which were applauded lustily, but he knew something to the discredit of nearly every one 

of his guests, 
and was consequently perfunctory. When they had not cheated, it was bhang, 

women, or worse, and even the desirables wanted to get something out of him. He believed 

that a "Bridge Party" did good rather than harm, or he would not have given one, but he was 

under no illusions, and at the proper moment he retired to the English side of the lawn. The 

impressions he left behind him were various. Many of the guests, especially the humbler and 



less Anglicized, were genuinely grateful. To be addressed 
by so high an official was a permanent 

asset. They did not mind how long they stood, or how little happened, and when seven o'clock 

struck, they had to be turned out. Others were grateful with more intelligence. The Nawab Bahadur, 

indifferent for himself and for the distinction with which he was greeted, was moved by 

the mere kindness that must have prompted the invitation. He knew the difficulties. Hamidullah 

also thought that the Collector had played up well. But others, such as Mahmoud Ali, we
re cynical; 

they were firmly convinced that Turton had been made to give the party by his official superiors 

and was all the time consumed with impotent rage, and they infected some who were 

inclined to a healthier view. Yet even Mahmoud Ali was glad he had come. Shrines are fascinating, 

especially when rarely opened, and it amused him to note the ritual of the English club, and 

to caricature it afterwards to his friends. 

After Mr. Turton, the official who did his duty best was Mr. Fielding, th
e Principal of the little 

Government College. He knew little of the district and less against the inhabitants, so he was in 

a less cynical state of mind. Athletic and cheerful, he romped about, making numerous mistakes 

which the parents of his pupils tried to cover up, for he was popular among them. When the 

moment for refreshments came, he did not move back to the English side, but burnt his mouth 

with gram. He talked to anyone and he ate anything. Amid much that was alien, he learnt that 

the 
two new ladies from England had been a great success, and that their politeness in wishing 

to be Mrs. Bhattacharya's guests had pleased not only her but all Indians who heard of it. It 

pleased Mr. Fielding also. He scarcely knew the two new ladies, still he decided to tell them 

what pleasure they had given by their friendliness. 

He found the younger of them alone. She was looking through a nick in the cactus hedge at 

the distant Marabar Hills, which had crept near, as was their custom at sunset; 
if the sunset had 

lasted long enough, they would have reached the town, but it was swift, being tropical. He gave 

her his information, and she was so much pleased and thanked him so heartily that he asked 

her and the other lady to tea. 

"I'd like to come very much indeed, and so would Mrs. Moore, I know." 

"I'm rather a hermit, you know." 

"Much the best thing to be in this place." 

"Owing to my work and so on, I don't get up much to the club." 

"I know, I know, and we never get down from it. I 
envy you being with Indians." 

"Do you care to meet one or two?" 

"Very, very much indeed; it's what I long for. This party to-day makes me so angry and miserable. 

I think my countrymen out here must be mad. Fancy inviting guests and not treating 

them properly! You and Mr. Turton and perhaps Mr. McBryde are the only people who showed 

any common politeness. The rest make me perfectly ashamed, and it's got worse and worse." 

It had. The Englishmen had intended to play up better, but had been prevent
ed from doing 

so by their women folk, whom they had to attend, provide with tea, advise about dogs, etc. 

When tennis began, the barrier grew impenetrable. It had been hoped to have some sets between 

East and West, but this was forgotten, and the courts were monopolized by the usual 

club couples. Fielding resented it too, but did not say so to the girl, for he found something 

theoretical in her outburst. Did she care about Indian music? he enquired; there was an old professor 

down at the College
, who sang. 

"Oh, just what we wanted to hear. And do you know Doctor Aziz?" 

"I know all about him. I don't know him. Would you like him asked too?" 

"Mrs. Moore says he is so nice." 

"Very well. Miss Quested. Will Thursday suit you?" 

"Indeed it will, and that morning we go to this Indian lady's. All the nice things are coming 

Thursday." 

"I won't ask the City Magistrate to bring you. I know he'll be busy at that time." 

"Yes, Ronny is always hard-worked," she replied, contemplating the hills. H
ow lovely they 

suddenly were! But she couldn't touch them. In front, like a shutter, fell a vision of her married 



life. She and Ronny would look into the club like this every evening, then drive home to dress; 

they would see the Lesleys and the Callendars and the Turtons and the Burtons, and invite 

them and be invited by them, while the true India slid by unnoticed. Colour would remain—the 

pageant of birds in the early morning, brown bodies, white turbans, idols whose flesh was scarlet 

or b
lue—and movement would remain as long as there were crowds in the bazaar and bathers 

in the tanks. Perched up on the seat of a dogcart, she would see them. But the force that 

lies behind colour and movement would escape her even more effectually than it did now. She 

would see India always as a frieze, never as a spirit, and she assumed that it was a spirit o'f 

which Mrs. Moore had had a glimpse. 

And sure enough they did drive away from the club in a few minutes, and they did dress, 

and to din
ner came Miss Derek and the McBrydes, and the menu was: Julienne soup full of bullety 

bottled peas, pseudo-cottage bread, fish full of branching bones, pretending to be plaice, 

more bottled peas with the cutlets, trifle, sardines on toast: the menu of Anglo-India. A dish 

might be added or subtracted as one rose or fell in the official scale, the peas might rattle less 

or more, the sardines and the vermouth be imported by a different firm, but the tradition remained; 

the food of exiles, cooked by 
servants who did not understand it. Adela thought of the 

young men and women who had come out before her, P. & O. full after P. & O. full, and had 

been set down to the same food and the same ideas, and been snubbed in the same goodhumoured 

way until they kept to the accredited themes and began to snub others. "I should 

never get like that," she thought, for she was young herself; all the same she knew that she 

had come up against something that was both insidious and tough, and against which she 


needed allies. She must gather around her at Chandrapore a few people who felt as she did, 

and she was glad to have met Mr. Fielding and the Indian lady with the unpronounceable name. 

Here at all events was a nucleus; she should know much better where she stood in the course 

of the next two days. 

Miss Derek— she companioned a Maharani in a remote Native State. She was genial and gay 

and made them all laugh about her leave, which she had taken because she felt she deserved 

it, not because th
e Maharani said she might go. Now she wanted to take the Maharajah's 

motor-car as well; it had gone to a Chiefs' Conference at Delhi, and she had a great scheme for 

burgling it at the junction as it came back in the train. She was also very funny about the Bridge 

Party— indeed she regarded the entire peninsula as a comic opera. "If one couldn't see the 

laughable side of these people one 'Id be done for," said Miss Derek. Mrs. McBryde— it was she 

who had been the nurse— ceased not to exclaim
, "Oh, Nancy, how topping! Oh, Nancy, how killing! 

I wish I could look at things like that." Mr. McBryde did not speak much; he seemed nice. 

When the guests had gone, and Adela gone to bed, there was another interview between 

mother and son. He wanted her advice and support— while resenting interference. "Does Adela 

talk to you much?" he began. "I'm so driven with work, I don't see her as much as I hoped, but 

I hope she finds things comfortable." 

"Adela and I talk mostly about India. Dear, si
nce you mention it, you're quite right— you 

ought to be more alone with her than you are." 

Yes, perhaps, but then people'id gossip." 

"Well, they must gossip sometime! Let them gossip." 

"People are so odd out here, and it's not like home— one's always facing the footlights, as 

the Burra Sahib said. Take a silly little example: when Adela went out to the boundary of the 

club compound, and Fielding followed her. I saw Mrs. Callendar notice it. They notice everything, 

until they're perfectly 
sure you're their sort. " 

"I don't think Adela'll ever be quite their sort— she's much too individual." 

"I know, that's so remarkable about her," he said thoughtfully. Mrs. Moore thought him 

rather absurd. Accustomed to the privacy of London, she could not realize that India, seemingly 

so mysterious, contains none, and that consequently the conventions have greater force. "I 

suppose nothing's on her mind," he continued. 

"Ask her, ask her yourself, my dear boy." 



"Probably she's heard tales
 of the heat, but of course I should pack her off to the Hills every 

April~rm not one to keep a wife grilling in the Plains." 

"Oh, it wouldn't be the weather." 

"There's nothing in India but the weather, my dear mother; it's the Alpha and Omega of the 

whole affair." 

"Yes, as Mrs. McBryde was saying, but it's much more the Anglo-Indians themselves who 

are likely to get on Adela's nerves. She doesn't think they behave pleasantly to Indians, you 

see." 

"What did I tell you?" he exclaimed, losing
 his gentle manner. "I knew it last week. Oh, how 

like a woman to worry over a side-issue!" 

She forgot about Adela in her surprise. "A side-issue, a side-issue?" she repeated. "How can 

it be that?" 

"We're not out here for the purpose of behaving pleasantly!" 

"What do you mean?" 

"What I say. We're out here to do justice and keep the peace. Them's my sentiments. India 

isn't a drawingroom." 

"Your sentiments are those of a god," she said quietly, but it was his manner rather than his 

sentimen
ts that annoyed her. 

Trying to recover his temper, he said, "India likes gods." 

"And Englishmen like posing as gods." 

"There's no point in all this. Here we are, and we're going to stop, and the country's got to 

put up with us, gods or no gods. Oh, look here," he broke out, rather pathetically, "what do you 

and Adela want me to do? Go against my class, against all the people I respect and admire out 

here? Lose such power as I have for doing good in this country because my behaviour isn't 

plea
sant? You neither of you understand what work is, or you 'Id never talk such eyewash. I 

hate talking like this, but one must occasionally. It's morbidly sensitive to go on as Adela and 

you do. I noticed you both at the club to-day—after the Burra Sahib had been at all that trouble 

to amuse you. I am out here to work, mind, to hold this wretched country by force. I'm not a 

missionary or a Labour Member or a vague sentimental sympathetic literary man. I'm just a 

servant of the Government; it's th
e profession you wanted me to choose myself, and that's that. 

We're not pleasant in India, and we don't intend to be pleasant. We've something more important 

to do." 

He spoke sincerely. Every day he worked hard in the court trying to decide which of two untrue 

accounts was the less untrue, trying to dispense justice fearlessly, to protect the weak 

against the less weak, the incoherent against the plausible, surrounded by lies and flattery. That 

morning he had convicted a railway clerk of overch
arging pilgrims for their tickets, and a Pathan 

of attempted rape. He expected no gratitude, no recognition for this, and both clerk and Pathan 

might appeal, bribe their witnesses more effectually in the interval, and get their sentences reversed. 

It was his duty. But he did expect sympathy from his own people, and except from newcomers 

he obtained it. He did think he ought not to be worried about "Bridge Parties" when the 

day's work was over and he wanted to play tennis with his equals or rest h
is legs upon a long 

chair. 

He spoke sincerely, but she could have wished with less gusto. How Ronny revelled in the 

drawbacks of his situation! How he did rub it in that he was not in India to behave pleasantly, 

and derived positive satisfaction therefrom! He reminded her of his public-schooldays. The 

traces of young-man humanitarianism had sloughed off, and he talked like an intelligent and 

embittered boy. His words without his voice might have impressed her, but when she heard the 

self-sati
sfied lilt of them, when she saw the mouth moving so complacently and competently 

beneath the little red nose, she felt, quite illogically, that this was not the last word on India. 

One touch of regret—not the canny substitute but the true regret from the heart— would have 

made him a different man, and the British Empire a different institution. 

"I'm going to argue, and indeed dictate," she said, clinking her rings. "The English are out 



here to be pleasant." 

"How do you make that out, mot
her?" he asked, speaking gently again, for he was ashamed 
of his irritability. 

"Because India is part of the earth. And God has put us on the earth in order to be pleasant 
to each other. God . . . is . . . love." She hesitated, seeing how much he disliked the argument, 
hut something made her go on. "God has put us on earth to love our neighbours and to show 
it, and He is omnipresent, even in India, to see how we are succeeding." 
He looked gloomy, and a little anxious. He knew this religious strain i
n her, and that it was a 
symptom of bad health; there had been much of it when his stepfather died. He thought, "She 
is certainly ageing, and I ought not to be vexed with anything she says." 
"The desire to behave pleasantly satisfies God . . . The sincere if impotent desire wips His 
blessing. I think everyone fails, but there are so many kinds of failure. Good will and more good 
will and more good will. Though I speak with the tongues of . . ." 
He waited until she had done, and then said gently, "I q
uite see that. I suppose I ought to 
get off to my files now, and you'll be going to bed." 

"I suppose so, I suppose so." They did not part for a few minutes, but the conversation had 
become unreal since Christianity had entered it. Ronny approved of religion as long as it endorsed 
the National Anthem, but he objected when it attempted to influence his life. Then he 
would say in respectful yet decided tones, "I don't think it does to talk about these things, every 
fellow has to work out his own religi
on," and any fellow who heard him muttered, "Hear! " 
Mrs. Moore felt that she had made a mistake in mentioning God, but she found him increasingly 
difficult to avoid as she grew older, and he had been constantly in her thoughts since she 
entered India, though oddly enough he satisfied her less. She must needs pronounce his name 
frequently, as the greatest she knew, yet she had never found it less efficacious. Outside the 
arch there seemed always an arch, beyond the remotest echo a silence. And she reg
retted afterwards 
that she had not kept to the real serious subject that had caused her to visit India— 
namely, the relationship between Ronny and Adela. Would they, or would they not, succeed in 
becoming engaged to be married? 
CHAPTER VI 

! Aziz had not gone to the Bridge Party. Immediately after his meeting with Mrs. Moore he 
was diverted to other matters. Several surgical cases came in, and kept him busy. He ceased to 
be either outcaste or poet, and became the medical student, very gay, and ful
l of details of 
operations 

which he poured into the shrinking ears of his friends. His profession fascinated him at 
times, but he required it to be exciting, and it was his hand, not his mind, that was scientific. 
The knife he loved and used skilfully, and he also liked pumping in the latest serums. But the 
boredom of rEgime and hygiene repelled him, and after inoculating a man for enteric, he would 
go away and drink unfiltered water himself "What can you expect from the fellow?" said dour 
Major Ca
llendar. "No grits, no guts." But in his heart he knew that if Aziz and not he had operated 
last year on Mrs. Graysford's appendix, the old lady would probably have lived. And this 
did not dispose him any better towards his subordinate. 

There was a row the morning after the mosque—they were always having rows. The Major, 
who had been up half the night, wanted damn well to know why Aziz had not come promptly 
when summoned. 

"Sir, excuse me, I did. I mounted my bike, and it bust in front of the Cow 
Hospital. So I had 
to find a tonga. " 

"Bust in front of the Cow Hospital, did it? And how did you come to be there?" 
"I beg your pardon?" 

"Oh Lord, oh Lord! When I live here "--he kicked the gravel--" and you live there—not ten 
minutes from me— and the Cow Hospital is right ever so far away the other side of you— 
there— then how did you come to be passing the Cow Hospital on the way to me? Now do 
some work for a change." 



He strode away in a temper, without waiting for the excuse, which
 as far as it went was a 
sound one: the Cow Hospital was in a straight line between Hamidullah's house and his own, so 
Aziz had naturally passed it. He never realized that the educated Indians visited one another 
constantly, and were weaving, however painfully, a new social fabric. Caste "or something of 
the sort" would prevent them. He only knew that no one ever told him the truth, although he 
had been in the country for twenty years. 

Aziz watched him go with amusement. When his spirits were up he 
felt that the English are 
a comic institution, and he enjoyed being misunderstood by them. But it was an amusement of 
the emotions and nerves, which an accident or the passage of time might destroy; it was apart 
from the fundamental gaiety that he reached when he was with those whom he trusted. A 
disobliging 

simile involving Mrs. Callendar occurred to his fancy. "I must tell that to Mahmoud Ali, 
it'll make him laugh," he thought. Then he got to work. He was competent and indispensable, 
and he knew 
it. The simile passed from his mind while he exercised his professional skill. 
During these pleasant and busy days, he heard vaguely that the Collector was giving a 
party, and that the Nawab Bahadur said everyone ought to go to it. His fellowassistant. Doctor 
Panna Lai, was in ecstasies at the prospect, and was urgent that they should attend it together 
in his newtum-tum. The arrangement suited them both. Aziz was spared the indignity of a bicycle 
or the expense of hiring, while Dr. Panna Lai, who was
 timid and elderly, secured someone 
who could manage his horse. He could manage it himself, but only just, and he was afraid of 
the motors and of the unknown turn into the club grounds. "Disaster may come," he said politely, 
"but we shall at all events get there safe, even if we do not get back." And with more 
logic: "It will, I think, create a good impression should two doctors arrive at the same time." 
But when the time came, Aziz was seized with a revulsion, and determined not to go. For 
one thing
 his spell of work, lately concluded, left him independent and healthy. For another, the 
day chanced to fall on the anniversary of his wife's death. She had died soon after he had fallen 
in love with her; he had not loved her at first. Touched by Western feeling, he disliked union 
with a woman whom he had never seen; moreover, when he did see her, she disappointed him, 
and he begat his first child in mere animality. The change began after its birth. He was won by 
her love for him, by a loyalty that im
plied something more than submission, and by her efforts 
to educate herself against that lifting of the purdah that would come in the next generation if 
not in theirs. She was intelligent, yet had old-fashioned grace. Gradually he lost the feeling that 
his relatives had chosen wrongly for him. Sensuous enjoyment— well, even if he had had it, it 
would have dulled in a year, and he had gained something instead, which seemed to increase 
the longer they lived together. She became the mother of a son . .
 . and in giving him a second 
son she died. Then he realized what he had lost, and that no woman could ever take her place; 
a friend would come nearer to her than another woman. She had gone, there was no one like 
her, and what is that uniqueness but love? He amused himself, he forgot her at times: but at 
other times he felt that she had sent all the beauty and joy of the world into Paradise, and he 
meditated suicide. Would he meet her beyond the tomb? Is there such a meetingplace? Though 
orthodox, h
e did not know. God's unity was indubitable and indubitably announced, but on all 
other points he wavered like the average Christian; his belief in the life to come would pale to a 
hope, vanish, reappear, all in a single sentence or a dozen heart-beats, so that the corpuscles of 
his blood rather than he seemed to decide which opinion he should hold, and for how long. It 
was so with all his opinions. Nothing stayed, nothing passed that did not return; the circulation 
was ceaseless and kept him young, a
nd he mourned his wife the more sincerely because he 
mourned her seldom. 

It would have been simpler to tell Dr. Lai that he had changed his mind about the party, but 
until the last minute he did not know that he had changed it; indeed, he didn't change it, it 
changed itself Unconquerable aversion welled. Mrs. Callendar, Mrs. Lesley—no, he couldn't 
stand them in his sorrow: they would guess it— for he dowered the British matron with strange 
insight— and would delight in torturing him, they woul
d mock him to their husbands. When he 



should have been ready, he stood at the Post Office, writing a telegram to his children, and 

found on his return that Dr. Lai had called for him, and gone on. Well, let him go on, as befitted 

the coarseness of his nature. For his own part, he would commune with the dead. 

And unlocking a drawer, he took out his wife's photograph. He gazed at it, and tears 

spouted from his eyes. He thought, "How unhappy I am! " But because he really was unhappy, 

another emo
tion soon mingled with his self-pity: he desired to remember his wife and could 

not. Why could he remember people whom he did not love? They were always so vivid to him, 

whereas the more he looked at this photograph, the less he saw. She had eluded him thus, ever 

since they had carried her to her tomb. He had known that she would pass from his hands and 

eyes, but had thought she could live in his mind, not realizing that the very fact that we have 

loved the dead increases their unreality, and tha
t the more passionately we invoke them the 

further they recede. A piece of brown cardboard and three children—that was all that was left of 

his wife. It was unbearable, and he thought again, "How unhappy I am! " and became happier. 

He had breathed for an instant the mortal air that surrounds Orientals and all men, and he drew 

back from it with a gasp, for he was young. "Never, never shall I get over this," he told himself 

"Most certainly my career is a failure, and my sons will be badly brought
 up." Since it was certain, 

he strove to avert it, and looked at some notes he had made on a case at the hospital. 

Perhaps some day a rich person might require this particular operation, and he gain a large 

sum. The notes interesting him on their own account, he locked the photograph up again. Its 

moment was over, and he did not think about his wife any more. 

After tea his spirits improved, and he went round to see Hamidullah. Hamidullah had gone 

to the party, but his pony had not, so Aziz borr
owed it, also his friend's riding breeches and polo 

mallet. He repaired to the Maidan. It was deserted except at its rim, where some bazaar youths 

were training. Training for what? They would have found it hard to say, but the word had got 

into the air. Round they ran, weedy and knock-kneed—the local physique was wretched— with an 

expression on their faces not so much of determination as of a deterinination to be determined. 

"Maharajah, salaam," he called for a joke. The youths stopped and la
ughed. He advised them 

not to exert themselves. They promised they would not, and ran on. 

Riding into the middle, he began to knock the ball about. He could not play, but his pony 

could, and he set himself to learn, free from all human tension. He forgot the whole damned 

business of living as he scurried over the brown platter of the Maidan, with the evening wind on 

his forehead, and the encircling trees soothing his eyes. The ball shot away towards a stray 

subaltern who was also practising; he
 hit it back to Aziz and called, "Send it along again." 

"All right." 

The new-comer had some notion of what to do, but his horse had none, and forces were 

equal. Concentrated on the ball, they somehow became fond of one another, and smiled when 

they drew rein to rest. Aziz liked soldiers— they either accepted you or swore at you, which was 

preferable to the civilian's hauteur— and the subaltern liked anyone who could ride. 

"Often play?" he asked. 

"Never." 

"Let's have another chukker." 


As he hit, his horse bucked and off he went, cried, "Oh God! "and jumped on again. "Don't 

you ever fall off?" 

"Plenty." 

"Not you." 

They reined up again, the fire of good fellowship in their eyes. But it cooled with their bodies, 

for athletics can only raise a temporary glow. Nationality was returning, but before it could 

exert its poison they parted, saluting each other. "If only they were all like that," each thought. 

Now it was sunset. A few of his co-religionists had come to the Maidan, an
d were praying 

with their faces towards Mecca. A Brahminy Bull walked towards them, and Aziz, though 

disinclined 

to pray himself, did not see why they should be bothered with the clumsy and idolatrous 



animal. He gave it a tap with his polo mallet. As he did so, a voice from the road hailed him: it 

was Dr. Panna Lai, returning in high distress from the Collector's party. 

"Dr. Aziz, Dr. Aziz, where you been? I waited ten full minutes' time at your house, then I 

went. " 

"I am so awfully sorr
y ~I was compelled to go to the Post Office." 

One of his own circle would have accepted this as meaning that he had changed his mind, 

an event too common to merit censure. But Dr. Lai, being of low extraction, was not sure 

whether an insult had not been intended, and he was further annoyed because Aziz had buffeted 

the Brahminy Bull. "Post Office? Do you not send your servants?" he said. 

"I have so few~my scale is very small." 

"Your servant spoke to me. I saw your servant." 

"But, Dr. Lai, con
sider. How could I send my servant when you were coming: you come, we 

go, my house is left alone, my servant comes back perhaps, and all my portable property has 

been carried away by bad characters in the meantime. Would you have that? The cook is deaf— 

I can never count on my cook—and the boy is only a little boy. Never, never do I and Hassan 

eave the house at the same time together. It is my fixed rule." He said all this and much more 

out of civility, to save Dr. Lai's face. It was not offe
red as truth and should not have been criticized 

as such. But the other demolished it—an easy and ignoble task. "Even if this so, what prevents 

leaving a chit saying where you go?" and so on. Aziz detested ill breeding, and made his 

pony caper. "Farther away, or mine will start out of sympathy," he wailed, revealing the true 

source of his irritation. "It has been so rough and wild this afternoon. It spoiled some most 

valuable blossoms in the club garden, and had to be dragged back by four men. 
English ladies 

and gentlemen looking on, and the Collector Sahib himself taking a note. But, Dr. Aziz, I'll not 

take up your valuable time. This will not interest you, who have so many engagements and 

telegrams. I am just a poor old doctor who thought right to pay my respects when I was asked 

and where I was asked. Your absence, I may remark, drew commentaries." 

"They can damn well comment." 

"It is fine to be young. Damn well! Oh, very fine. Damn whom?" 

"I go or not as I please." 

"Yet you p
romise me, and then fabricate this tale of a telegram. Go forward. Dapple." 

They went, and Aziz had a wild desire to make an enemy for life. He could do it so easily by 

galloping near them. He did it. Dapple bolted. He thundered back on to the Maidan. The glory 

of his play with the subaltern remained for a little, he galloped and swooped till he poured with 

sweat, and until he returned the pony to Hamidullah's stable he felt the equal of any man. Once 

on his feet, he had creeping fears. Was he in
 bad odour with the powers that be? Had he offended 

the Collector by absenting himself? Dr. Panna La! was a person of no importance, yet 

was it wise to have quarrelled even with him? The complexion of his mind turned from human 

to political. He thought no longer, "Can I get on with people?" but "Are they stronger than I?" 

breathing the prevalent miasma. 

At his home a chit was awaiting him, bearing the Government stamp. It lay on his table like 

a high explosive, which at a touch might blow his f
limsy bungalow to bits. He was going to be 

cashiered because he had not turned up at the party. When he opened the note, it proved to be 

quite different; an invitation from Mr. Fielding, the Principal of Government College, asking him 

to come to tea the day after to-morrow. His spirits revived with violence. They would have revived 

in any case, for he possessed a soul that could suffer but not stifle, and led a steady life 

beneath his mutability. But this invitation gave him particular joy, becau
se Fielding had asked 

him to tea a month ago, and he had forgotten about it-never answered, never gone, just forgotten. 

And here came a second invitation, without a rebuke or even an allusion to his slip. Here 

was true courtesy— the civil deed that shows the good heart— and snatching up his pen he wrote 

an affectionate reply, and hurried back for news to Hamidullah's. For he had never met the 

Principal, and believed that the one serious gap in his life was going to be filled. He longed to 

k
now everything about the splendid fellow— his salary, preferences, antecedents, how best one 



might please him. But Hamidullah was still out, and Mahmoud Ali, who was in, would only make 

silly rude jokes about the party. 

CHAPTER VII 

This Mr. Fielding had been caught by India late. He was over forty when he entered that 

oddest portal, the Victoria Terminus at Bombay, and—having bribed a European ticket 

inspector—took his luggage into the compartment of his first tropical train. The journe
y remained 

in his mind as significant. Of his two carriage companions one was a youth, fresh to the 

East like himself, the other a seasoned Anglo-Indian of his own age. A gulf divided him from 

either; he had seen too many cities and men to be the first or to become the second. New 

impressions 

crowded on him, but they were not the orthodox new impressions; the past conditioned 

them, and so it was with his mistakes. To regard an Indian as if he were an Italian is not, 

for instance, a common err
or, nor perhaps a fatal one, and Fielding often attempted analogies 

between this peninsula and that other, smaller and more exquisitely shaped, that stretches into 

the classic waters of the Mediterranean. 

His career, though scholastic, was varied, and had included going to the bad and repenting 

thereafter. By now he was a hard-bitten, good-tempered, intelligent fellow on the verge of middle 

age, with a belief in education. He did not mind whom he taught; public schoolboys, mental 

defectives and
 policemen, had all come his way, and he had no objection to adding Indians. 

Through the influence of friends, he was nominated Principal of the little college at Chandrapore, 

liked it, and assumed he was a success. He did succeed with his pupils, but the gulf between 

himself and his countrymen, which he had noticed in the train, widened distressingly. He 

could not at first see what was wrong. He was not unpatriotic, he always got on with Englishmen 

in England, all his best friends were English, 
so why was it not the same out here? Outwardly 

of the large shaggy type, with sprawling limbs and blue eyes, he appeared to inspire 

confidence until he spoke. Then something in his manner puzzled people and failed to allay the 

distrust which his profession naturally inspired. There needs must be this evil of brains in India, 

but woe to him through whom they are increased! The feeling grew that Mr. Fielding was a 

disruptive 

force, and rightly, for ideas are fatal to caste, and he used ideas by t
hat most potent 

method— interchange. Neither a missionary nor a student, he was happiest in the give-and-take 

of a private conversation. The world, he believed, is a globe of men who are trying to reach one 

another and can best do so by the help of good will plus culture and intelligence— a creed ill 

suited to Chandrapore, but he had come out too late to lose it. He had no racial feeling— not 

because he was superior to his brother civilians, but because he had matured in a different 

atmos
phere, 

where the herdinstinct does not flourish. The remark that did him most harm at the 

club was a silly aside to the effect that the socalled white races are really pinko-grey. He only 

said this to be cheery, he did not realize that "white" has no more to do with a colour than "God 

save the King" with a god, and that it is the height of impropriety to consider what it does connote. 

The pinko-grey male whom he addressed was subtly scandalized; his sense of insecurity 

was awoken, and he commun
icated it to the rest of the herd. 

Still, the men tolerated him for the sake of his good heart and strong body; it was their 

wives who decided that he was not a sahib really. They disliked him. He took no notice of them, 

and this, which would have passed without comment in feminist England, did him harm in a 

community where the male is expected to be lively and helpful. Mr. Fielding never advised one 

about dogs or horses, or dined, or paid his midday calls, or decorated trees for one's children a
t 

Christmas, and though he came to the club, it was only to get his tennis or billiards, and to go. 

This was true. He had discovered that it is possible to keep in with Indians and Englishmen, but 

that he who would also keep in with Englishwomen must drop the Indians. The two wouldn't 

combine. Useless to blame either party, useless to blame them for blaming one another. It just 

was so, and one had to choose. Most Englishmen preferred their own kinswomen, who, coming 



out in increasing numbers,
 made life on the home pattern yearly more possible. He had found it 

convenient and pleasant to associate with Indians and he must pay the price. As a rule no 

Englishwoman 

entered the College except for official functions, and if he invited Mrs. Moore and 

Miss Quested to tea, it was because they were new-comers who would view everything with an 

equal if superficial eye, and would not turn on a special voice when speaking to his other 

guests. 

The College itself had been slapped down by the Pub
lic Works Department, but its grounds 

included an ancient garden and a garden-house, and here he lived for much of the year. He was 

dressing after a bath when Dr. Aziz was announced. Lifting up his voice, he shouted from the 

bedroom, "Please make yourself at home." The remark was unpremeditated, like most of his 

actions; it was what he felt inclined to say. 

To Aziz it had a very definite meanng. "May I really, Mr. Fielding? It's very good of you," he 

called back; "I like unconventional behaviou
r so extremely." His spirits flared up, he glanced 

round the living-room. Some luxury in it, but no order —nothing to intimidate poor Indians. It 

was also a very beautiful room, opening into the garden through three high arches of wood. 

"The fact is I have long wanted to meet you," he continued. "I have heard so much about your 

warm heart from the Nawab Bahadur. But where is one to meet in a wretched hole like 

Chandrapore?" He came close up to the door. "When I was greener here, I'll tell you w
hat. I 

used to wish you to fall ill so that we could meet that way." They laughed, and encouraged by 

his success he began to improvise. "I said to myself. How does Mr. Fielding look this morning? 

Perhaps pale. And the Civil Surgeon is pale too, he will not be able to attend upon him when 

the shivering commences. I should have been sent for instead. Then we would have had jolly 

talks, for you are a celebrated student of Persian poetry." 

You know me by sight, then." 

Of course, of course. You kn
ow me?" 

I know you very well by name." 

I have been here such a short time, and always in the bazaar. No wonder you have never 
seen me, and I wonder you know my name. I say, Mr. Fielding?" 

Yes?" 

Guess what I look like before you come out. That will be a kind of game." 

You're five feet nine inches high," said Fielding, surmising this much through the ground 
glass of the bedroom door. 

Jolly good. What next? Have I not a venerable white beard?" 

Blast! 

Anything wrong?" 

I've stamped on my las
t collar stud." 

Take mine, take mine." 

Have you a spare one?" 

Yes, yes, one minute." 

Not if you're wearing it yourself" 

No, no, one in my pocket." Stepping aside, so that his outline might vanish, he wrenched 
off his collar, and pulled out of his shirt the back stud, a gold stud, which was part of a set that 
his brother-in-law had brought him from Europe. " Here it is," he cried. 
"Come in with it if you don't mind the unconventionality." 

"One minute again." Replacing his collar, he prayed th
at it would not spring up at the back 
during tea. Fielding's bearer, who was helping him to dress, opened the door for him. 
"Many thanks." They shook hands smiling. He began to look round, as he would have with 
any old friend. Fielding was not surprised at the rapidity of their intimacy. With so emotional a 
people it was apt to come at once or never, and he and Aziz, having heard only good of each 
other, could afford to dispense with preliminaries. 
"But I always thought that Englishmen kept their roo
ms so tidy. It seems that this is not so. 



I need not be so ashamed." He sat down gaily on the bed; then, forgetting himself entirely, 

drew up his legs and folded them under him. "Everything ranged coldly on shelves was what 

_I_ thought.—I say, Mr. Fielding, is the stud going to go in?" 

"Ihae madoots." 

"What's that last sentence, please? Will you teach me some new words and so improve my 

English?" 

Fielding doubted whether "everything ranged coldly on shelves" could be improved. He was 

of
ten struck with the liveliness with which the younger generation handled a foreign tongue. 

They altered the idiom, but they could say whatever they wanted to say quickly; there were 

none of the babuisms ascribed to them up at the club. But then the club moved slowly; it still 

declared that few Mohammedans and no Hindus would eat at an Englishman's table, and that 

all Indian ladies were in impenetrable purdah. Individually it knew better; as a club it declined 

to change. 

"Let me put in your stud
. I see . . . the shirt back's hole is rather small and to rip it wider a 

pity." 

"Why in hell does one wear collars at all?" grumbled Fielding as he bent his neck. 

"We wear them to pass the Police." 

"What's that?" 

"If I'm biking in English dress—starch collar, hat with ditch—they take no notice. When I 

wear a fez, they cry, 'Your lamp's out!' Lord Curzon did not consider this when he urged natives 

of India to retain their picturesque costumes.— Hooray! Stud's gone in.— Sometimes I shu
t my 

eyes and dream I have splendid clothes again and am riding into battle behind Alamgir. Mr. 

Fielding, must not India have been beautiful then, with the Mogul Empire at its height and 

Alamgir reigning at Delhi upon the Peacock Throne?" 

"Two ladies are coming to tea to meet you— I think you know them." 

"Meet me? I know no ladies." 

"Not Mrs. Moore and Miss Quested?" 

"Oh yes— I remember." The romance at the mosque had sunk out of his consciousness as 

soon as it was over. "An excessively
 aged lady; but will you please repeat the name of her 

companion?" 

"Miss Quested." 

"Just as you wish." He was disappointed that other guests were coming, for he preferred to 

be alone with his new friend. 

"You can talk to Miss Quested about the Peacock Throne if you like— she's artistic, they say." 

"Is she a Post Impressionist?" 

"Post Impressionism, indeed! Come along to tea. This world is getting too much for me altogether." 

Aziz was offended. The remark suggested that he, an obscure Indi
an, had no right to have 

heard of Post Impressionism— a privilege reserved for the Ruling Race, that. He said stiffly, "I do 

not consider Mrs. Moore my friend, I only met her accidentally in my mosque," and was adding 

"a single meeting is too short to make a friend," but before he could finish the sentence the 

stiffness vanished from it, because he felt Fielding's fundamental good will. His own went out to 

it, and grappled beneath the shifting tides of emotion which can alone bear the voyager t
o an 

anchorage but may also carry him across it on to the rocks. He was safe really— as safe as the 

shore-dweller who can only understand stability and supposes that every ship must be wrecked, 

and he had sensations the shore-dweller cannot know. Indeed, he was sensitive rather than 

responsive. 

In every remark he found a meaning, but not always the true meaning, and his life 

though vivid was largely a dream. Fielding, for instance, had not meant that Indians are obscure, 

but that Post Impre
ssionism is; a gulf divided his remark from Mrs. Turton's "Why, they 

speak English," but to Aziz the two sounded alike. Fielding saw that something had gone wrong, 

and equally that it had come right, but he didn't fidget, being an optimist where personal relations 

were concerned, and their talk rattled on as before. 



"Besides the ladies I am expecting one of my assistants—Narayan Godbole." 

"Oho, the Deccani Brahman!" 

"He wants the past back too, but not precisely Alamgir." 

"I should think 
not. Do you know what Deccani Brahmans say? That England conquered India 

from them—from them, mind, and not from the Moguls. Is not that like their cheek? They 

have even bribed it to appear in text-books, for they are so subtle and immensely rich. Professor 

Godbole must be quite unlike all other Deccani Brahmans from all I can hear say. A most 

sincere chap." 

"Why don't you fellows run a club in Chandrapore, Aziz?" 

"Perhaps—some day . . . just now I see Mrs. Moore and— what's her name— c
oming." 

How fortunate that it was an "unconventional" party, where formalities are ruled out! On 

this basis Aziz found the English ladies easy to talk to, he treated them like men. Beauty would 

have troubled him, for it entails rules of its own, but Mrs. Moore was so old and Miss Quested 

so plain that he was spared this anxiety. Adela's angular body and the freckles on her face were 

terrible defects in his eyes, and he wondered how God could have been so unkind to any female 

form. His attitude 
towards her remained entirely straightforward in consequence. 

"I want to ask you something. Dr. Aziz," she began. "I heard from Mrs. Moore how helpful 

you were to her in the mosque, and how interesting. She learnt more about India in those few 

minutes' talk with you than in the three weeks since we landed." 

"Oh, please do not mention a little thing like that. Is there anything else I may tell you 

about my country?" 

"I want you to explain a disappointment we had this morning; it must be some poi
nt of Indian 

etiquette." 

"There honestly is none," he replied. "We are by nature a most informal people." 

"I am afraid we must have made some blunder and given offence," said Mrs. Moore. 

"That is even more impossible. But may I know the facts?" 

"An Indian lady and gentleman were to send their carriage for us this morning at nine. It 

has never come. We waited and waited and waited; we can't think what happened." 

"Some misunderstanding," said Fielding, seeing at once that it was the type of inc
ident that 

had better not be cleared up. 

"Oh no, it wasn't that," Miss Quested persisted. "They even gave up going to Calcutta to 

entertain us. We must have made some stupid blunder, we both feel sure." 

"I wouldn't worry about that." 

"Exactly what Mr. Heaslop tells me," she retorted, reddening a little. "If one doesn't worry, 

how's one to understand?" 

The host was inclined to change the subject, but Aziz took it up warmly, and on learning 

fragments of the delinquents' name pronounced that t
hey were Hindus. 

" Slack Hindus— they have no idea of society; I know them very well because of a doctor at 

the hospital. Such a slack, unpunctual fellow! It is as well you did not go to their house, for it 

would give you a wrong idea of India. Nothing sanitary. I think for my own part they grew 

ashamed of their house and that is why they did not send." 

"That's a notion," said the other man. 

"I do so hate mysteries," Adela announced. 

"We English do." 

"I dislike them not because I'm Englis
h, but from my own personal point of view," she corrected. 

"I like mysteries but I rather dislike muddles," said Mrs. Moore. 

"A mystery is a muddle." 

"Oh, do you think so, Mr. Fielding?" 

"A mystery is only a high-sounding term for a muddle. No advantage in stirring it up, in either 

case. Aziz and I know well that India's a muddle." 

"India's— Oh, what an alarming idea!" 

"There'll be no muddle when you come to see me," said Aziz, rather out of his depth. "Mrs. 



Moore and every one~I invite
 you all~oh, please." 

The old lady accepted: she still thought the young doctor excessively nice; moreover, a new 

feeling, half languor, half excitement, bade her turn down any fresh path. Miss Quested accepted 

out of adventure. She also liked Aziz, and believed that when she knew him better he 

would unlock his country for her. His invitation gratified her, and she asked him for his address. 

Aziz thought of his bungalow with horror. It was a detestable shanty near a low bazaar. 

There was practi
cally only one room in it, and that infested with small black flies. "Oh, but we 

will talk of something else now," he exclaimed. "I wish I lived here. See this beautiful room! Let 

us admire it together for a little. See those curves at the bottom of the arches. What delicacy! It 

is the architecture of Question and Answer. Mrs. Moore, you are in India; I am not joking." The 

room inspired him. It was an audience hall built in the eighteenth century for some high official, 

and though of wood had rem
inded Fielding of the Loggia de' Lanzi at Florence. Little rooms, 

now Europeanized, clung to it on either side, but the central hall was unpapered and unglassed, 

and the air of the garden poured in freely. One sat in public—on exhibition, as it were—in full 

view of the gardeners who were screaming at the birds and of the man who rented the tank for 

the cultivation of water chestnut. Fielding let the mango trees too— there was no knowing who 

might not come in— and his servants sat on his s
teps night and day to discourage thieves. Beautiful 

certainly, and the Englishman had not spoilt it, whereas Aziz in an occidental moment 

would have hung Maude Goodmans on the walls. Yet there was no doubt to whom the room 

really belonged. . . . 

"I am doing justice here. A poor widow who has been robbed comes along and I give her 

fifty rupees, to another a hundred, and so on and so on. I should like that." 

Mrs. Moore smiled, thinking of the modem method as exemplified in her son. "Rupees don't 


last for ever, I'm afraid," she said. 

"Mine would. God would give me more when he saw I gave. Always be giving, like the Nawab 

Bahadur. My father was the same, that is why he died poor." And pointing about the room 

he peopled it with clerks and officials, all benevolent because they lived long ago. "So we would 

sit giving for ever— on a carpet instead of chairs, that is the chief change between now and 

then, but I think we would never punish anyone." 

The ladies agreed. 

"Poor criminal, giv
e him another chance. It only makes a man worse to go to prison and be 

corrupted." His face grew very tender— the tenderness of one incapable of administration, and 

unable to grasp that if the poor criminal is let off he will again rob the poor widow. He was tender 

to everyone except a few family enemies whom he did not consider human: on these he 

desired revenge. He was even tender to the English; he knew at the bottom of his heart that 

they could not help being so cold and odd and circulating
 like an ice stream through his land. 

"We punish no one, no one," he repeated, "and in the evening we will give a great banquet with 

a nautch and lovely girls shall shine on every side of the tank with fireworks in their hands, and 

all shall be feasting and happiness until the next day, when there shall be justice as before— fifty 

rupees, a hundred, a thousand— till peace comes. Ah, why didn't we live in that time ?— But are 

you admiring Mr. Fielding's house? Do look how the pillars are pai
nted blue, and the verandah's 

pavilions— what do you call them ?— that are above us inside are blue also. Look at the carving 

on the pavilions. Think of the hours it took. Their little roofs are curved to imitate bamboo. So 

pretty— and the bamboos waving by the tank outside. Mrs. Moore! Mrs. Moore! " 

"Well?" she said, laughing. 

"You remember the water by our mosque? It comes down and fills this tank— a skilful arrangement 

of the Emperors. They stopped here going down into Bengal. They l
oved water. 

Wherever they went they created fountains, gardens, hammams. I was telling Mr. Fielding I 

would give anything to serve them." 

He was wrong about the water, which no Emperor, however skilful, can cause to gravitate 

uphill; a depression of some depth together with the whole of Chandrapore lay between the 

mosque and Fielding's house. Ronny would have pulled him up, Turton would have wanted to 



pull him up, but restrained himself. Fielding did not even want to pull him up; he had dulle
d his 

craving for verbal truth and cared chiefly for truth of mood. As for Miss Quested, she accepted 

everything Aziz said as true verbally. In her ignorance, she regarded him as "India," and never 

surmised that his outlook was limited and his method inaccurate, and that no one is India. 

He was now much excited, chattering away hard, and even saying damn when he got mixed 

up in his sentences. He told them of his profession, and of the operations he had witnessed and 

performed, and he went into 
details that scared Mrs. Moore, though Miss Quested mistook them 

for proofs of his broad-mindedness; she had heard such talk at home in advanced academic 

circles, deliberately free. She supposed him to be emancipated as well as reliable, and placed 

him on a pinnacle which he could not retain. He was high enough for the moment, to be sure, 

but not on any pinnacle. Wings bore him up, and flagging would deposit him. 

The arrival of Professor Godbole quieted him somewhat, but it remained his afternoon
. The 

Brahman, polite and enigmatic, did not impede his eloquence, and even applauded it. He took 

his tea at a little distance from the outcasts, from a low table placed slightly behind him, to 

which he stretched back, and as it were encountered food by accident; all feigned indifference 

to Professor Godbole's tea. He was elderly and wizen with a grey moustache and grey-blue 

eyes, and his complexion was as fair as a European's. He wore a turban that looked like pale 

purple macaroni, coat, waist
coat, dhoti, socks with clocks. The clocks matched the turban, and 

his whole appearance suggested harmony—as if he had reconciled the products of East and 

West, mental as well as physical, and could never be discomposed. The ladies were interested 

in him, and hoped that he would supplement Dr. Aziz by saying something about religion. But 

he only ate—ate and ate, smiling, never letting his eyes catch sight of his hand. 

Leaving the Mogul Emperors, Aziz turned to topics that could distress no on
e. He described 

the ripening of the mangoes, and how in his boyhood he used to run out in the Rains to a big 

mango grove belonging to an uncle and gorge there. "Then back with water streaming over you 

and perhaps rather a pain inside. But I did not mind. All my friends were paining with me. We 

have a proverb in Urdu: 'What does unhappiness matter when we are all unhappy together?' 

which comes in conveniently after mangoes. Miss Quested, do wait for mangoes. Why not settle 

altogether in India?" 


"I'm afraid I can't do that," said Adela. She made the remark without thinking what it 

meant. To her, as to the three men, it seemed in key with the rest of the conversation, and not 

for several minutes— indeed, not for half an hour— did she realize that it was an important remark, 

and ought to have been made in the first place to Ronny. 

"Visitors like you are too rare." 

"They are indeed," said Professor Godbole. "Such affability is seldom seen. But what can we 

offer to detain them? " 

"
Mangoes, mangoes." 

They laughed. "Even mangoes can be got in England now," put in Fielding. "They ship them 

in ice-cold rooms. You can make India in England apparently, just as you can make England in 

India." 

"Frightfully expensive in both cases," said the girl. 

"I suppose so." 

"And nasty." 

But the host wouldn't allow the conversation to take this heavy turn. He turned to the old 

lady, who looked flustered and put out— he could not imagine why— and asked about her own 

plans. She repli
ed that she should like to see over the College. Everyone immediately rose, with 

the exception of Professor Godbole, who was finishing a banana. 

"Don't you come too, Adela; you dislike institutions." 

"Yes, that is so," said Miss Quested, and sat down again. 

Aziz hesitated. His audience was splitting up. The more familiar half was going, but the 

more attentive remained. Refiecting that it was an "unconventional" afternoon, he stopped. 

Talk went on as before. Could one offer the visitors unripe m
angoes in a fool? "I speak now 



as a doctor: no." Then the old man said, "But I will send you up a few healthy sweets. I will 

give myself that pleasure." 

"Miss Quested, Professor Godbole's sweets are delicious," said Aziz sadly, for he wanted to 

send sweets too and had no wife to cook them. "They will give you a real Indian treat. Ah, in 

my poor position I can give you nothing." 

"I don't know why you say that, when you have so kindly asked us to your house." 

He thought again of his bungalow 
with horror. Good heavens, the stupid girl had taken him 

at his word! What was he to do? "Yes, all that is settled," he cried. "I invite you all to see me in 

the Marabar Caves." 

"I shall be delighted." 

"Oh, that is a most magnificent entertainment compared to my poor sweets. But has not 

Miss Quested visited our caves already?" 

"No. I've not even heard of them." 

"Not heard of them?" both cried. "The Marabar Caves in the Marabar Hills?" 

"We hear nothing interesting up at the club. Only tennis
 and ridiculous gossip." 

The old man was silent, perhaps feeling that it was unseemly of her to criticize her race, 

perhaps fearing that if he agreed she would report him for disloyalty. But the young man uttered 

a rapid "I know." 

"Then tell me everything you will, or I shall never understand India. Are they the hills I 

sometimes see in the evening? What are these caves?" 

Aziz undertook to explain, but it presently appeared that he had never visited the caves 

himself—had always been "meanin
g" to go, but work or private business had prevented him, 

and they were so far. Professor Godbole chaffed him pleasantly. "My dear young sir, the pot and 

the kettle! Have you ever heard of that useful proverb?" 

"Are they large caves?" she asked. 

"No, not large." 

"Do describe them. Professor Godbole." 

"It will be a great honour." He drew up his chair and an expression of tension came over his 

face. Taking the cigarette box, she offered to him and to Aziz, and lit up herself After an 

impressi
ve 

pause he said: "There is an entrance in the rock which you enter, and through the entrance 

is the cave." 

"Something like the caves at Elephanta?" 

"Oh no, not at all; at Elephanta there are sculptures of Siva and Parvati. There are no sculptures 

at Marabar." 

"They are immensely holy, no doubt," said Aziz, to help on the narrative. 

"Oh no, oh no." 

"Still, they are ornamented in some way." 

"Oh no." 

"Well, why are they so famous? We all talk of the famous Marabar Caves. Perhaps that is 


our empty brag." 

"No, I should not quite say that." 

"Describe them to this lady, then." 

"It will be a great pleasure." He forewent the pleasure, and Aziz realized that he was keeping 

back something about the caves. He realized because he often suffered from similar inhibitions 

himself Sometimes, to the exasperation of Major Callendar, he would pass over the one 

relevant fact in a position, to dwell on the hundred irrelevant. The Major accused him of 

disingenuousness, 

and was roughly right,
 but only roughly. It was rather that a power he couldn't 

control capriciously silenced his mind. Godbole had been silenced now; no doubt not willingly, 

he was concealing something. Handled subtly, he might regain control and announce that the 

Marabar Caves were—full of stalactites, perhaps; Aziz led up to this, but they weren't. 



The dialogue remained light and friendly, and Adela had no conception of its underdrift. She 

did not know that the comparatively simple mind of the Mohammedan was en
countering Ancient 

Night. Aziz played a thrilling game. He was handling a human toy that refused to work—he 

knew that much. If it worked, neither he nor Professor Godbole would be the least advantaged, 

but the attempt enthralled him and was akin to abstract thought. On he chattered, defeated at 

every move by an opponent who would nof even admit that a move had been made, and further 

than ever from discovering what, if anything, was extraordinary about the Marabar Caves. 

Into this Ronny droppe
d. 

With an annoyance he took no trouble to conceal, he called from the garden: "What's happened 

to Fielding? Where's my mother?" 

"Good evening!" she replied coolly. 

"I want you and mother at once. There's to be polo." 

"I thought there was to he no polo." 

"Everything's altered. Some soldier men have come in. Come along and I'll tell you about it." 

"Your mother will return shortly, sir," said Professor Godbole, who had risen with deference. 

"There is but little to see at our poor college." 


Ronny took no notice, but continued to address his remarks to Adela; he had hurried away 

from his work to take her to see the polo, because he thought it would give her pleasure. He 

did not mean to be rude to the two men, but the only link he could be conscious of with an Indian 

was the official, and neither happened to be his subordinate. As private individuals he forgot 

them. 

Unfortunately Aziz was in no mood to be forgotten. He would not give up the secure and 

intimate note of the last hour.
 He had not risen with Godbole, and now, offensively friendly, 

called from his seat, "Come along up and join us, Mr. Heaslop; sit down till your mother turns 

up." 

Ronny replied by ordering one of Fielding's servants to fetch his master at once. 

"He may not understand that. Allow me--" Aziz repeated the order idiomatically. 

Ronny was tempted to retort; he knew the type; he knew all the types, and this was the 

spoilt Westernized. But he was a servant of the Government, it was his job to avoid "in
cidents," 

so he said nothing, and ignored the provocation that Aziz continued to offer. Aziz was provocative. 

Everything he said had an impertinent flavour or jarred. His wings were failing, but he refused 

to fall without a struggle. He did not mean to be impertinent to Mr. Heaslop, who had 

never done him harm, but here was an Anglo-Indian who must become a man before comfort 

could be regained. He did not mean to be greasily confidential to Miss Quested, only to enlist 

her support; nor to be lo
ud and jolly towards Professor Godbole. A strange quartette—he fluttering 

to the ground, she puzzled by the sudden ugliness, Ronny fuming, the Brahman observing 

all three, but with downcast eyes and hands folded, as if nothing was noticeable. A scene from 

a play, thought Fielding, who now saw them from the distance across the garden grouped 

among the blue pillars of his beautiful hall. 

"Don't trouble to come, mother," Ronny called; "we're just starting." Then he hurried to 

Fielding, drew him 
0H
Can't you see that fellow's a bounder?" 

Aziz flamboyant, was patronizing Mrs. Moore. 

"He isn't a bounder," protested Fielding. "His nerves are on edge, that's all." 

"What should have upset his precious nerves?" 



"I don't know. He was all right when I left." 

"Well, it's nothing I've said," said Ronny reassuringly. "I never even spoke to him." 

"Oh well, come along now, and take your ladies away; the catastrophe over." 

"Fielding . . . don't think I'm taking it badly, or anything of that sort. .
.. I suppose you 

won't come on to the polo with us? We should all be delighted." 

"I'm afraid I can't, thanks all the same. I'm awfully sorry you feel I've been remiss. I didn't 

mean to be." 

So the leave-taking began. Every one was cross or wretched. It was as if irritation exuded 

from the very soil. Could one have been so petty on a Scotch moor or an Italian alp? Fielding 

wondered afterwards. There seemed no reserve of tranquillity to draw upon in India. Either 

none, or else tranquillity swal
lowed up everything, as it appeared to do for Professor Godbole. 

Here was Aziz all shoddy and odious, Mrs. Moore and Miss Quested both silly, and he himself 

and Heaslop both decorous on the surface, but detestable really, and detesting each other. 

"Good-bye, Mr. Fielding, and thank you so much. What lovely College buildings!" 

"Good-bye, Mrs. Moore." 

"Good-bye, Mr. Fielding. Such an interesting afternoon ..." 

"Good-bye, Miss Quested." 

"Good-bye, Dr. Aziz." 

"Good-bye, Mrs. Moore." 

"Good-bye
, Dr. Aziz." 

"Good-bye, Miss Quested." He pumped her hand up and down to show that he felt at ease. 

"You'll jolly jolly well not forget those caves, won't you? I'll fix the whole show up in a jiffy." 

"Thank you. . ." 

Inspired by the devil to a final effort, he added, "What a shame you leave India so soon! 

Oh, do reconsider your decision, do stay." 

"Good-bye, Professor Godbole," she continued, suddenly agitated. "It's a shame we never 

heard you sing." 

"I may sing now," he replied, and did. 


His thin voice rose, and gave out one sound after another. At times there seemed rhythm, at 

times there was the illusion of a Western melody. But the ear, baffled repeatedly, soon lost any 

clue, and wandered in a maze of noises, none harsh or unpleasant, none intelligible. It was the 

song of an unknown bird. Only the servants understood it. They began to whisper to one another. 

The man who was gathering water chestnut came naked out of the tank, his lips parted 

with delight, disclosing his scarl
et tongue. The sounds continued and ceased after a few moments 

as casually as they had begun— apparently half through a bar, and upon the subs dominant. 

"Thanks so much: what was that?" asked Fielding. 

"I will explain in detail. It was a religious song. I placed myself in the position of a milkmaiden. 

I say to Shri Krishna, 'Come! come to me only.' The god refuses to come. I grow humble 

and say: 'Do not come to me only. Multiply yourself into a hundred Krishnas, and let one go 

to each of my h
undred companions, but one, O Lord of the Universe, come to me.' He refuses 

to come. This is repeated several times. The song is composed in a raga appropriate to the present 

hour, which is the evening." 

"But He comes in some other song, I hope?" said Mrs. Moore gently. 

"Oh no, he refuses to come," repeated Godbole, perhaps not understanding her question. "I 

say to Him, Come, come, come, come, come, come. He neglects to come." 

Ronny's steps had died away, and there was a moment of absolute sile
nce. No ripple disturbed 

the water, no leaf stirred. 

CHAPTER VIII 

Although Miss Quested had known Ronny well in England, she felt well advised to visit him 

before deciding to be his wife. India had developed sides of his character that she had never 

admired. His self-complacency, his censoriousness, his lack of subtlety, all grew vivid beneath a 

tropic sky; he seemed more indifferent than of old to what was passing in the minds of his fellows.

proved wrong, he was particularly exasperating; he always managed to suggest that she 

needn't have bothered to prove it. The point she made was never the relevant point, her arguments
